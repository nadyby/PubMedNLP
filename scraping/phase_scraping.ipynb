      "Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) originates from differentiated hepatocytes undergoing compensatory proliferation in livers damaged by viruses or metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)1. While increasing HCC risk2, MASH triggers p53-dependent hepatocyte senescence3, which we found to parallel hypernutrition-induced DNA breaks. How this tumour-suppressive response is bypassed to license oncogenic mutagenesis and enable HCC evolution was previously unclear. Here we identified the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) as a p53 target that is elevated in senescent-like MASH hepatocytes but suppressed through promoter hypermethylation and proteasomal degradation in most human HCCs. FBP1 first declines in metabolically stressed premalignant disease-associated hepatocytes and HCC progenitor cells4,5, paralleling the protumorigenic activation of AKT and NRF2. By accelerating FBP1 and p53 degradation, AKT and NRF2 enhance the proliferation and metabolic activity of previously senescent HCC progenitors. The senescence-reversing and proliferation-supportive NRF2-FBP1-AKT-p53 metabolic switch, operative in mice and humans, also enhances the accumulation of DNA-damage-induced somatic mutations needed for MASH-to-HCC progression.\n",

      "Abstract: Lung metastases occur in up to 54% of patients with metastatic tumours1,2. Contributing factors to this high frequency include the physical properties of the pulmonary system and a less oxidative environment that may favour the survival of cancer cells3. Moreover, secreted factors from primary tumours alter immune cells and the extracellular matrix of the lung, creating a permissive pre-metastatic environment primed for the arriving cancer cells4,5. Nutrients are also primed during pre-metastatic niche formation6. Yet, whether and how nutrients available in organs in which tumours metastasize confer cancer cells with aggressive traits is mostly undefined. Here we found that pulmonary aspartate triggers a cellular signalling cascade in disseminated cancer cells, resulting in a translational programme that boosts aggressiveness of lung metastases. Specifically, we observe that patients and mice with breast cancer have high concentrations of aspartate in their lung interstitial fluid. This extracellular aspartate activates the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in cancer cells, which promotes CREB-dependent expression of deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH). DOHH is essential for hypusination, a post-translational modification that is required for the activity of the non-classical translation initiation factor eIF5A. In turn, a translational programme with TGFβ signalling as a central hub promotes collagen synthesis in lung-disseminated breast cancer cells. We detected key proteins of this mechanism in lung metastases from patients with breast cancer. In summary, we found that aspartate, a classical biosynthesis metabolite, functions in the lung environment as an extracellular signalling molecule to promote aggressiveness of metastases.\n",

      "Abstract: Aberrant immune responses to viral pathogens contribute to pathogenesis, but our understanding of pathological immune responses caused by viruses within the human virome, especially at a population scale, remains limited. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing datasets of 6,321 Japanese individuals, including patients with autoimmune diseases (psoriasis vulgaris, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) or multiple sclerosis) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), or healthy controls. We systematically quantified two constituents of the blood DNA virome, endogenous HHV-6 (eHHV-6) and anellovirus. Participants with eHHV-6B had higher risks of SLE and PAP; the former was validated in All of Us. eHHV-6B-positivity and high SLE disease activity index scores had strong correlations. Genome-wide association study and long-read sequencing mapped the integration of the HHV-6B genome to a locus on chromosome 22q. Epitope mapping and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed distinctive immune induction by eHHV-6B in patients with SLE. In addition, high anellovirus load correlated strongly with SLE, RA and COVID-19 status. Our analyses unveil relationships between the human virome and autoimmune and infectious diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor with glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) enforcing the intra-tumoral hierarchy. Plasma cells (PCs) are critical effectors of the B-lineage immune system, but their roles in glioblastoma remain largely unexplored. Here, we leverage single-cell RNA and B cell receptor sequencing of tumor-infiltrating B-lineage cells and reveal that PCs are aberrantly enriched in the glioblastoma-infiltrating B-lineage population, experience low level of somatic hypermutation, and are associated with poor prognosis. PCs secrete immunoglobulin G (IgG), which stimulates GSC proliferation via the IgG-FcγRIIA-AKT-mTOR axis. Disruption of IgG-FcγRIIA paracrine communication inhibits GSC proliferation and self-renewal. Glioblastoma-infiltrating PCs are recruited to GSC niches via CCL2-CCR2 chemokine program. GSCs further derive pro-proliferative signals from broadly utilized monoclonal antibody-based immune checkpoint inhibitors via FcγRIIA signaling. Our data generate an atlas of B-lineage cells in glioblastoma with a framework for combinatorial targeting of both tumor cell-intrinsic and microenvironmental dependencies.\n",

      "Abstract: Pyroptosis mediated by gasdermins (GSDMs) plays crucial roles in infection and inflammation. Pyroptosis triggers the release of inflammatory molecules, including damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). However, the consequences of pyroptosis-especially beyond interleukin (IL)-1 cytokines and DAMPs-that govern inflammation are poorly defined. Here, we show intercellular propagation of pyroptosis from dying cells to bystander cells in vitro and in vivo. We identified extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by pyroptotic cells as the propagator of lytic death to naive cells, promoting inflammation. DNA-PAINT super-resolution and immunoelectron microscopy revealed GSDMD pore structures on EVs released by pyroptotic cells. Importantly, pyroptotic EVs transplant GSDMD pores on the plasma membrane of bystander cells and kill them. Overall, we demonstrate that cell-to-cell vesicular transplantation of GSDMD pores disseminates pyroptosis, revealing a domino-like effect governing disease-associated bystander cell death.\n",

      "Abstract: Lysine lactylation plays critical roles in various diseases, including cancer. Our previous study showed that lactylation of non-histone ABCF1 may be involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic value of ABCF1-K430la in HCC using immunohistochemical staining and performed amino acid point mutations, multi-omics crossover, and biochemical experiments to investigate its biological role and underlying mechanism. Additionally, we performed molecular docking on lactylation sites. ABCF1-K430la was highly expressed in HCC tissues and correlated with poor patient prognosis. Functionally, ABCF1-K430la promoted HCC growth and lung metastasis. Mechanistically, upon lactylation, E2 ubiquitin ligase activity of ABCF1 remained unaffected, and ABCF1 entered the nucleus, bound to the KDM3A promoter to upregulate its expression, and activated the KDM3A-H3K9me2-HIF1A axis, challenging the notion that ABCF1 functions exclusively in cytoplasmic protein translation. Notably, we discovered the existence of a lactate-ABCF1(430Kla)-HIF1A-lactate in HCC. A small-molecule drug screen targeting ABCF1-K430la revealed that tubuloside A inhibits ABCF1-K430la and suppresses HCC development. These findings demonstrate that elevated ABCF1-K430la expression promotes HCC development, suggesting it as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.\n",

      "Abstract: Biological ageing can be defined as a gradual loss of homeostasis across various aspects of molecular and cellular function1,2. Mammalian brains consist of thousands of cell types3, which may be differentially susceptible or resilient to ageing. Here we present a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing dataset containing roughly 1.2 million high-quality single-cell transcriptomes of brain cells from young adult and aged mice of both sexes, from regions spanning the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. High-resolution clustering of all cells results in 847 cell clusters and reveals at least 14 age-biased clusters that are mostly glial types. At the broader cell subclass and supertype levels, we find age-associated gene expression signatures and provide a list of 2,449 unique differentially expressed genes (age-DE genes) for many neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. Whereas most age-DE genes are unique to specific cell types, we observe common signatures with ageing across cell types, including a decrease in expression of genes related to neuronal structure and function in many neuron types, major astrocyte types and mature oligodendrocytes, and an increase in expression of genes related to immune function, antigen presentation, inflammation, and cell motility in immune cell types and some vascular cell types. Finally, we observe that some of the cell types that demonstrate the greatest sensitivity to ageing are concentrated around the third ventricle in the hypothalamus, including tanycytes, ependymal cells, and certain neuron types in the arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and paraventricular nucleus that express genes canonically related to energy homeostasis. Many of these types demonstrate both a decrease in neuronal function and an increase in immune response. These findings suggest that the third ventricle in the hypothalamus may be a hub for ageing in the mouse brain. Overall, this study systematically delineates a dynamic landscape of cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes in the brain associated with normal ageing that will serve as a foundation for the investigation of functional changes in ageing and the interaction of ageing and disease.\n",

      "Abstract: Animals have evolved pH-sensing membrane receptors, such as G-protein-coupled receptor 4 (GPR4), to monitor pH changes related to their physiology and generate adaptive reactions. However, the evolutionary trajectory and structural mechanism of proton sensing by GPR4 remain unresolved. Here, we observed a positive correlation between the optimal pH of GPR4 activity and the blood pH range across different species. By solving 7-cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Xenopus tropicalis GPR4 (xtGPR4) and Mus musculus GPR4 (mmGPR4) under varying pH conditions, we identified that protonation of HECL2-45.47 and H7.36 enabled polar network establishment and tighter association between the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) and 7 transmembrane (7TM) domain, as well as a conserved propagating path, which are common mechanisms underlying protonation-induced GPR4 activation across different species. Moreover, protonation of distinct extracellular HECL2-45.41 contributed to the more acidic optimal pH range of xtGPR4. Overall, our study revealed common and distinct mechanisms of proton sensing by GPR4, from a structural, functional, and evolutionary perspective.\n",

      "abstract: Lung metastases occur in up to 54% of patients with metastatic tumours1,2. Contributing factors to this high frequency include the physical properties of the pulmonary system and a less oxidative environment that may favour the survival of cancer cells3. Moreover, secreted factors from primary tumours alter immune cells and the extracellular matrix of the lung, creating a permissive pre-metastatic environment primed for the arriving cancer cells4,5. Nutrients are also primed during pre-metastatic niche formation6. Yet, whether and how nutrients available in organs in which tumours metastasize confer cancer cells with aggressive traits is mostly undefined. Here we found that pulmonary aspartate triggers a cellular signalling cascade in disseminated cancer cells, resulting in a translational programme that boosts aggressiveness of lung metastases. Specifically, we observe that patients and mice with breast cancer have high concentrations of aspartate in their lung interstitial fluid. This extracellular aspartate activates the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in cancer cells, which promotes CREB-dependent expression of deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH). DOHH is essential for hypusination, a post-translational modification that is required for the activity of the non-classical translation initiation factor eIF5A. In turn, a translational programme with TGFβ signalling as a central hub promotes collagen synthesis in lung-disseminated breast cancer cells. We detected key proteins of this mechanism in lung metastases from patients with breast cancer. In summary, we found that aspartate, a classical biosynthesis metabolite, functions in the lung environment as an extracellular signalling molecule to promote aggressiveness of metastases.\n",

      "abstract: Aberrant immune responses to viral pathogens contribute to pathogenesis, but our understanding of pathological immune responses caused by viruses within the human virome, especially at a population scale, remains limited. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing datasets of 6,321 Japanese individuals, including patients with autoimmune diseases (psoriasis vulgaris, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) or multiple sclerosis) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), or healthy controls. We systematically quantified two constituents of the blood DNA virome, endogenous HHV-6 (eHHV-6) and anellovirus. Participants with eHHV-6B had higher risks of SLE and PAP; the former was validated in All of Us. eHHV-6B-positivity and high SLE disease activity index scores had strong correlations. Genome-wide association study and long-read sequencing mapped the integration of the HHV-6B genome to a locus on chromosome 22q. Epitope mapping and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed distinctive immune induction by eHHV-6B in patients with SLE. In addition, high anellovirus load correlated strongly with SLE, RA and COVID-19 status. Our analyses unveil relationships between the human virome and autoimmune and infectious diseases.\n",

      "abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) originates from differentiated hepatocytes undergoing compensatory proliferation in livers damaged by viruses or metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)1. While increasing HCC risk2, MASH triggers p53-dependent hepatocyte senescence3, which we found to parallel hypernutrition-induced DNA breaks. How this tumour-suppressive response is bypassed to license oncogenic mutagenesis and enable HCC evolution was previously unclear. Here we identified the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) as a p53 target that is elevated in senescent-like MASH hepatocytes but suppressed through promoter hypermethylation and proteasomal degradation in most human HCCs. FBP1 first declines in metabolically stressed premalignant disease-associated hepatocytes and HCC progenitor cells4,5, paralleling the protumorigenic activation of AKT and NRF2. By accelerating FBP1 and p53 degradation, AKT and NRF2 enhance the proliferation and metabolic activity of previously senescent HCC progenitors. The senescence-reversing and proliferation-supportive NRF2-FBP1-AKT-p53 metabolic switch, operative in mice and humans, also enhances the accumulation of DNA-damage-induced somatic mutations needed for MASH-to-HCC progression.\n",
