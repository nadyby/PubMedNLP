abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) originates from differentiated hepatocytes undergoing compensatory proliferation in livers damaged by viruses or metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)1. While increasing HCC risk2, MASH triggers p53-dependent hepatocyte senescence3, which we found to parallel hypernutrition-induced DNA breaks. How this tumour-suppressive response is bypassed to license oncogenic mutagenesis and enable HCC evolution was previously unclear. Here we identified the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) as a p53 target that is elevated in senescent-like MASH hepatocytes but suppressed through promoter hypermethylation and proteasomal degradation in most human HCCs. FBP1 first declines in metabolically stressed premalignant disease-associated hepatocytes and HCC progenitor cells4,5, paralleling the protumorigenic activation of AKT and NRF2. By accelerating FBP1 and p53 degradation, AKT and NRF2 enhance the proliferation and metabolic activity of previously senescent HCC progenitors. The senescence-reversing and proliferation-supportive NRF2-FBP1-AKT-p53 metabolic switch, operative in mice and humans, also enhances the accumulation of DNA-damage-induced somatic mutations needed for MASH-to-HCC progression.

abstract: Lung metastases occur in up to 54% of patients with metastatic tumours1,2. Contributing factors to this high frequency include the physical properties of the pulmonary system and a less oxidative environment that may favour the survival of cancer cells3. Moreover, secreted factors from primary tumours alter immune cells and the extracellular matrix of the lung, creating a permissive pre-metastatic environment primed for the arriving cancer cells4,5. Nutrients are also primed during pre-metastatic niche formation6. Yet, whether and how nutrients available in organs in which tumours metastasize confer cancer cells with aggressive traits is mostly undefined. Here we found that pulmonary aspartate triggers a cellular signalling cascade in disseminated cancer cells, resulting in a translational programme that boosts aggressiveness of lung metastases. Specifically, we observe that patients and mice with breast cancer have high concentrations of aspartate in their lung interstitial fluid. This extracellular aspartate activates the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in cancer cells, which promotes CREB-dependent expression of deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH). DOHH is essential for hypusination, a post-translational modification that is required for the activity of the non-classical translation initiation factor eIF5A. In turn, a translational programme with TGFβ signalling as a central hub promotes collagen synthesis in lung-disseminated breast cancer cells. We detected key proteins of this mechanism in lung metastases from patients with breast cancer. In summary, we found that aspartate, a classical biosynthesis metabolite, functions in the lung environment as an extracellular signalling molecule to promote aggressiveness of metastases.

abstract: Aberrant immune responses to viral pathogens contribute to pathogenesis, but our understanding of pathological immune responses caused by viruses within the human virome, especially at a population scale, remains limited. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing datasets of 6,321 Japanese individuals, including patients with autoimmune diseases (psoriasis vulgaris, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) or multiple sclerosis) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), or healthy controls. We systematically quantified two constituents of the blood DNA virome, endogenous HHV-6 (eHHV-6) and anellovirus. Participants with eHHV-6B had higher risks of SLE and PAP; the former was validated in All of Us. eHHV-6B-positivity and high SLE disease activity index scores had strong correlations. Genome-wide association study and long-read sequencing mapped the integration of the HHV-6B genome to a locus on chromosome 22q. Epitope mapping and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed distinctive immune induction by eHHV-6B in patients with SLE. In addition, high anellovirus load correlated strongly with SLE, RA and COVID-19 status. Our analyses unveil relationships between the human virome and autoimmune and infectious diseases.

abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor with glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) enforcing the intra-tumoral hierarchy. Plasma cells (PCs) are critical effectors of the B-lineage immune system, but their roles in glioblastoma remain largely unexplored. Here, we leverage single-cell RNA and B cell receptor sequencing of tumor-infiltrating B-lineage cells and reveal that PCs are aberrantly enriched in the glioblastoma-infiltrating B-lineage population, experience low level of somatic hypermutation, and are associated with poor prognosis. PCs secrete immunoglobulin G (IgG), which stimulates GSC proliferation via the IgG-FcγRIIA-AKT-mTOR axis. Disruption of IgG-FcγRIIA paracrine communication inhibits GSC proliferation and self-renewal. Glioblastoma-infiltrating PCs are recruited to GSC niches via CCL2-CCR2 chemokine program. GSCs further derive pro-proliferative signals from broadly utilized monoclonal antibody-based immune checkpoint inhibitors via FcγRIIA signaling. Our data generate an atlas of B-lineage cells in glioblastoma with a framework for combinatorial targeting of both tumor cell-intrinsic and microenvironmental dependencies.

abstract: Lysine lactylation plays critical roles in various diseases, including cancer. Our previous study showed that lactylation of non-histone ABCF1 may be involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic value of ABCF1-K430la in HCC using immunohistochemical staining and performed amino acid point mutations, multi-omics crossover, and biochemical experiments to investigate its biological role and underlying mechanism. Additionally, we performed molecular docking on lactylation sites. ABCF1-K430la was highly expressed in HCC tissues and correlated with poor patient prognosis. Functionally, ABCF1-K430la promoted HCC growth and lung metastasis. Mechanistically, upon lactylation, E2 ubiquitin ligase activity of ABCF1 remained unaffected, and ABCF1 entered the nucleus, bound to the KDM3A promoter to upregulate its expression, and activated the KDM3A-H3K9me2-HIF1A axis, challenging the notion that ABCF1 functions exclusively in cytoplasmic protein translation. Notably, we discovered the existence of a lactate-ABCF1(430Kla)-HIF1A-lactate in HCC. A small-molecule drug screen targeting ABCF1-K430la revealed that tubuloside A inhibits ABCF1-K430la and suppresses HCC development. These findings demonstrate that elevated ABCF1-K430la expression promotes HCC development, suggesting it as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.

abstract: Animals have evolved pH-sensing membrane receptors, such as G-protein-coupled receptor 4 (GPR4), to monitor pH changes related to their physiology and generate adaptive reactions. However, the evolutionary trajectory and structural mechanism of proton sensing by GPR4 remain unresolved. Here, we observed a positive correlation between the optimal pH of GPR4 activity and the blood pH range across different species. By solving 7-cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Xenopus tropicalis GPR4 (xtGPR4) and Mus musculus GPR4 (mmGPR4) under varying pH conditions, we identified that protonation of HECL2-45.47 and H7.36 enabled polar network establishment and tighter association between the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) and 7 transmembrane (7TM) domain, as well as a conserved propagating path, which are common mechanisms underlying protonation-induced GPR4 activation across different species. Moreover, protonation of distinct extracellular HECL2-45.41 contributed to the more acidic optimal pH range of xtGPR4. Overall, our study revealed common and distinct mechanisms of proton sensing by GPR4, from a structural, functional, and evolutionary perspective.

abstract: Nutrient availability strongly affects intestinal homeostasis. Here, we report that low-protein (LP) diets decrease amino acids levels, impair the DNA damage response (DDR), cause DNA damage and exacerbate inflammation in intestinal tissues of male mice with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Intriguingly, loss of nuclear fragile X mental retardation-interacting protein 1 (NUFIP1) contributes to the amino acid deficiency-induced impairment of the DDR in vivo and in vitro and induces necroptosis-related spontaneous enteritis. Mechanistically, phosphorylated NUFIP1 binds to replication protein A2 (RPA32) to recruit the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)-ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP) complex, triggering the DDR. Consistently, both reintroducing NUFIP1 but not its non-phospho-mutant and inhibition of necroptosis prevent bowel inflammation in male Nufip1 conditional knockout mice. Intestinal inflammation and DNA damage in male mice with IBD can be mitigated by NUFIP1 overexpression. Moreover, NUFIP1 protein levels in the intestine of patients with IBD were found to be significantly decreased. Conclusively, our study uncovers that LP diets contribute to intestinal inflammation by hijacking NUFIP1-DDR signalling and thereby activating necroptosis.

abstract: The biology underlying the connection between social relationships and health is largely unknown. Here, leveraging data from 42,062 participants across 2,920 plasma proteins in the UK Biobank, we characterized the proteomic signatures of social isolation and loneliness through proteome-wide association study and protein co-expression network analysis. Proteins linked to these constructs were implicated in inflammation, antiviral responses and complement systems. More than half of these proteins were prospectively linked to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and mortality during a 14 year follow-up. Moreover, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis suggested causal relationships from loneliness to five proteins, with two proteins (ADM and ASGR1) further supported by colocalization. These MR-identified proteins (GFRA1, ADM, FABP4, TNFRSF10A and ASGR1) exhibited broad associations with other blood biomarkers, as well as volumes in brain regions involved in interoception and emotional and social processes. Finally, the MR-identified proteins partly mediated the relationship between loneliness and cardiovascular diseases, stroke and mortality. The exploration of the peripheral physiology through which social relationships influence morbidity and mortality is timely and has potential implications for public health.

abstract: Three proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)-GPR4, GPR65, and GPR68-respond to extracellular pH to regulate diverse physiology. How protons activate these receptors is poorly understood. We determined cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of each receptor to understand the spatial arrangement of proton-sensing residues. Using deep mutational scanning (DMS), we determined the functional importance of every residue in GPR68 activation by generating ∼9,500 mutants and measuring their effects on signaling and surface expression. Constant-pH molecular dynamics simulations provided insights into the conformational landscape and protonation patterns of key residues. This unbiased approach revealed that, unlike other proton-sensitive channels and receptors, no single site is critical for proton recognition. Instead, a network of titratable residues extends from the extracellular surface to the transmembrane region, converging on canonical motifs to activate proton-sensing GPCRs. Our approach integrating structure, simulations, and unbiased functional interrogation provides a framework for understanding GPCR signaling complexity.

abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is accompanied by an altered gut microbiota but whether the latter contributes to carcinogenesis is unclear. Here we show that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using stool samples from patients with HCC spontaneously initiate liver inflammation, fibrosis and dysplasia in wild-type mice, and accelerate disease progression in a mouse model of HCC. We find that HCC-FMT results in gut barrier injury and translocation of live bacteria to the liver. Metagenomic analyses and bacterial culture of liver tissues reveal enrichment of the gut pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae in patients with HCC and mice transplanted with the HCC microbiota. Moreover, K. pneumoniae monocolonization recapitulates the effect of HCC-FMT in promoting liver inflammation and hepatocarcinogenesis. Mechanistically, K. pneumoniae surface protein PBP1B interacts with and activates TLR4 on HCC cells, leading to increased cell proliferation and activation of oncogenic signalling. Targeting gut colonization using K. oxytoca or TLR4 inhibition represses K. pneumoniae-induced HCC progression. These findings indicate a role for an altered gut microbiota in hepatocarcinogenesis.

abstract: Chemical reprogramming enables the generation of human pluripotent stem (hCiPS) cells from somatic cells using small molecules, providing a promising strategy for regenerative medicine. However, the current method is time consuming, and some cell lines from different donors are resistant to chemical induction, limiting the utility of this approach. Here, we developed a fast reprogramming system capable of generating hCiPS cells in as few as 10 days. This accelerated method enables efficient generation of hCiPS cells with a consistent 100% success rate across 15 different donors, increasing efficiency by over 20-fold within 16 days, especially for previously resistant cells. Mechanistically, we identified KAT3A/KAT3B and KAT6A as key epigenetic obstacles; suppressing these factors facilitated the transition of somatic cells to a poised state by triggering switches in the epigenome. These results highlight the superiority of this system for generating hCiPS cells, which represents a next-generation approach for manufacturing cells for further applications.

abstract: Pyroptosis mediated by gasdermins (GSDMs) plays crucial roles in infection and inflammation. Pyroptosis triggers the release of inflammatory molecules, including damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). However, the consequences of pyroptosis-especially beyond interleukin (IL)-1 cytokines and DAMPs-that govern inflammation are poorly defined. Here, we show intercellular propagation of pyroptosis from dying cells to bystander cells in vitro and in vivo. We identified extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by pyroptotic cells as the propagator of lytic death to naive cells, promoting inflammation. DNA-PAINT super-resolution and immunoelectron microscopy revealed GSDMD pore structures on EVs released by pyroptotic cells. Importantly, pyroptotic EVs transplant GSDMD pores on the plasma membrane of bystander cells and kill them. Overall, we demonstrate that cell-to-cell vesicular transplantation of GSDMD pores disseminates pyroptosis, revealing a domino-like effect governing disease-associated bystander cell death.

abstract: Biological ageing can be defined as a gradual loss of homeostasis across various aspects of molecular and cellular function1,2. Mammalian brains consist of thousands of cell types3, which may be differentially susceptible or resilient to ageing. Here we present a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing dataset containing roughly 1.2 million high-quality single-cell transcriptomes of brain cells from young adult and aged mice of both sexes, from regions spanning the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. High-resolution clustering of all cells results in 847 cell clusters and reveals at least 14 age-biased clusters that are mostly glial types. At the broader cell subclass and supertype levels, we find age-associated gene expression signatures and provide a list of 2,449 unique differentially expressed genes (age-DE genes) for many neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. Whereas most age-DE genes are unique to specific cell types, we observe common signatures with ageing across cell types, including a decrease in expression of genes related to neuronal structure and function in many neuron types, major astrocyte types and mature oligodendrocytes, and an increase in expression of genes related to immune function, antigen presentation, inflammation, and cell motility in immune cell types and some vascular cell types. Finally, we observe that some of the cell types that demonstrate the greatest sensitivity to ageing are concentrated around the third ventricle in the hypothalamus, including tanycytes, ependymal cells, and certain neuron types in the arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and paraventricular nucleus that express genes canonically related to energy homeostasis. Many of these types demonstrate both a decrease in neuronal function and an increase in immune response. These findings suggest that the third ventricle in the hypothalamus may be a hub for ageing in the mouse brain. Overall, this study systematically delineates a dynamic landscape of cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes in the brain associated with normal ageing that will serve as a foundation for the investigation of functional changes in ageing and the interaction of ageing and disease.

abstract: Acute and chronic inflammation are important pathologies of benign airway stenosis (BAS) fibrosis, which is a frequent complication of critically ill patients. cGAS-STING signalling has an important role in inflammation and fibrosis, yet the function of STING in BAS remains unclear. Here we demonstrate using scRNA sequencing that cGAS‒STING signalling is involved in BAS, which is accompanied by increased dsDNA, expression and activation of STING. STING inhibition or deficiency effectively alleviates tracheal fibrosis of BAS mice by decreasing both acute and chronic inflammation. Macrophage depletion also effectively ameliorates BAS. Mechanistically, dsDNA from damaged epithelial cells activates the cGAS-STING pathway of macrophages and induces IL-6 to activate STAT3 and promote fibrosis. In summary, the present results suggest that cGAS-STING signalling induces acute inflammation and amplifies the chronic inflammation and tracheal fibrosis associated with benign airway stenosis, highlighting the mechanism and potential drug target of BAS.

abstract: Osteoarthritis is a heterogeneous disorder that is increasingly prevalent largely due to aging and obesity, resulting in a major disease burden worldwide. Knowledge about the underlying aetiology has improved, with increased understanding of the role of genetic factors, the microbiome, and existence of different pain mechanisms. However, this knowledge has not yet been translated into new treatment options. New evidence has questioned the efficacy of recommended treatments, such as therapeutic exercise programmes and the focus on weight loss, but managing obesity and maintaining activity remain important for the prevention and management of osteoarthritis. Approaches should consider individual and cultural preferences and resource availability to increase patient and community engagement, and optimise outcomes worldwide. Most of the focus has been on established osteoarthritis where management is primarily directed at relieving symptoms. The search for the much needed effective treatments that improve both symptoms and structure, often referred to as disease-modifying osteoarthritic drugs, is ongoing. Promising data indicate that targeting inflammation is effective in hand osteoarthritis.

abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis relies on the presence of extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau). Emerging evidence suggests a potential link between AD pathologies and infectious agents, with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) being a leading candidate. Our investigation, using metagenomics, mass spectrometry, western blotting, and decrowding expansion pathology, detects HSV-1-associated proteins in human brain samples. Expression of the herpesvirus protein ICP27 increases with AD severity and strongly colocalizes with p-tau but not with Aβ. Modeling in human brain organoids shows that HSV-1 infection elevates tau phosphorylation. Notably, p-tau reduces ICP27 expression and markedly decreases post-infection neuronal death from 64% to 7%. This modeling prompts investigation into the cGAS-STING-TBK1 pathway products, nuclear factor (NF)-κB and IRF-3, which colocalizes with ICP27 and p-tau in AD. Furthermore, experimental activation of STING enhances tau phosphorylation, while TBK1 inhibition prevents it. Together, these findings suggest that tau phosphorylation acts as an innate immune response in AD, driven by cGAS-STING.

abstract: Maintaining blood glucose homeostasis during fasting and feeding is crucial for the prevention of dysregulation that can lead to either hypo- or hyperglycaemia. Here we identified feimin, encoded by a gene with a previously unknown function (B230219D22Rik in mice, C5orf24 in humans), as a key modulator of glucose homeostasis. Feimin is secreted from skeletal muscle during feeding and binds to its receptor, receptor protein tyrosine kinase Mer (MERTK), promoting glucose uptake and inhibiting glucose production by activation of AKT. Administration of feimin and insulin synergistically improves blood glucose homeostasis in both normal and diabetic mice. Notably, a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (rs7604639, G>A) within the MERTK gene, causing an amino acid substitution (R466K) within the feimin-MERTK binding region, leads to reduced association with feimin and elevated postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels in humans. Our findings underscore a role of the feimin-MERTK signalling axis in glucose homeostasis, providing valuable insights into potential therapeutic avenues for diabetes.

abstract: Posttranslational modification (PTM) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent evidence reveals that lactylation modification, as a novel PTM, is implicated in the occurrence and development of AD. However, whether and how APP lactylation contributes to both the pathogenesis and cognitive function in AD remains unknown. Here, we observed a reduction in APP lactylation in AD patients and AD model mice and cells. Proteomic mass spectrometry analysis further identified lysine 612 (APP-K612la) as a crucial site for APP lactylation, influencing APP amyloidogenic processing. A lactyl-mimicking mutant (APPK612T) reduced amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) generation and slowed down cognitive deficits in vivo. Mechanistically, APPK612T appeared to facilitate APP trafficking and metabolism. However, lactylated APP entering the endosome inhibited its binding to BACE1, suppressing subsequent cleavage. Instead, it promoted protein interaction between APP and CD2-associated protein (CD2AP), thereby accelerating the endosomal-lysosomal degradation pathway of APP. In the APP23/PS45 double-transgenic mouse model of AD, APP-Kla was susceptible to L-lactate regulation, which reduced Aβ pathology and repaired spatial learning and memory deficits. Thus, these findings suggest that targeting APP lactylation may be a promising therapeutic strategy for AD in humans.

abstract: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have reported multiple risk loci for schizophrenia (SCZ). However, the majority of the associations were from populations of European ancestry. Here we conducted a large-scale GWAS in Eastern Asian populations (29,519 cases and 44,392 controls) and identified ten Eastern Asian-specific risk loci, two of which have not been previously reported. A further cross-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis (96,806 cases and 492,818 controls) including populations from diverse ancestries identified 61 previously unreported risk loci. Systematic variant-level analysis, including fine mapping, functional genomics and expression quantitative trait loci, prioritized potential causal variants. Gene-level analyses, including transcriptome-wide association study, proteome-wide association study and Mendelian randomization, nominated the potential causal genes. By integrating evidence from layers of different analyses, we prioritized the most plausible causal genes for SCZ, such as ACE, CNNM2, SNAP91, ABCB9 and GATAD2A. Finally, drug repurposing showed that ACE, CA14, MAPK3 and MAPT are potential therapeutic targets for SCZ. Our study not only showed the power of cross-ancestry GWAS in deciphering the genetic aetiology of SCZ, but also uncovered new genetic risk loci, potential causal variants and genes and therapeutic targets for SCZ.

abstract: Metabolic reprogramming fuels cancer cell metastasis and remodels the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). We report here that circPETH, a circular RNA (circRNA) transported via extracellular vesicles (EVs) from tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, facilitates glycolysis and metastasis in recipient HCC cells. Mechanistically, circPETH-147aa, encoded by circPETH in an m6A-driven manner, promotes PKM2-catalyzed ALDOA-S36 phosphorylation via the MEG pocket. Furthermore, circPETH-147aa impairs anti-HCC immunity by increasing HuR-dependent SLC43A2 mRNA stability and driving methionine and leucine deficiency in cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Importantly, through virtual and experimental screening, we find that a small molecule, Norathyriol, is an effective inhibitor that targets the MEG pocket on the circPETH-147aa surface. Norathyriol reverses circPETH-147aa-facilitated acquisition of metabolic and metastatic phenotypes by HCC cells, increases anti-PD1 efficacy, and enhances cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell function. Here we show that Norathyriol is a promising anti-HCC agent that contributes to attenuating the resistance of advanced HCC to immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapies.

abstract: Mechanistic understanding of the inhibitory immunoreceptor PD-1 is largely based on mouse models, but human and mouse PD-1 share only 59.6% amino acid identity. Here, we found that human PD-1 is more inhibitory than mouse PD-1, owing to stronger interactions with the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 and more efficient recruitment of the effector phosphatase Shp2. In a mouse melanoma model with adoptively transferred T cells, humanization of a PD-1 intracellular domain disrupted the antitumor activity of CD8+ T cells and increased the magnitude of anti-PD-1 response. We identified a motif highly conserved across vertebrate PD-1 orthologs, absent in rodents, as a key determinant for differential Shp2 recruitment. Evolutionary analysis suggested that PD-1 underwent a rodent lineage-specific functional attenuation during evolution. Together, our study uncovers species-specific features of the PD-1 pathway, with implications for PD-1 evolution and differential anti-PD-(L)1 responses in mouse models and human patients.

abstract: Nearly all pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PDAC) are genomically characterized by KRAS exon 2 mutations. Most patients with PDAC present with advanced disease and are treated with cytotoxic therapy. Genomic biomarkers prognostic of disease outcomes have been challenging to identify. Herein leveraging a cohort of 2,336 patients spanning all disease stages, we characterize the genomic and clinical correlates of outcomes in PDAC. We show that a genomic subtype of KRAS wild-type tumors is associated with early disease onset, distinct somatic and germline features, and significantly better overall survival. Allelic imbalances at the KRAS locus are widespread. KRAS mutant allele dosage gains, observed in one in five (20%) KRAS-mutated diploid tumors, are correlated with advanced disease and demonstrate prognostic potential across disease stages. With the rapidly expanding landscape of KRAS targeting, our findings have potential implications for clinical practice and for understanding de novo and acquired resistance to RAS therapeutics.

abstract: The NLRP3 inflammasome plays a critical role in innate immunity and inflammatory diseases. NIMA-related kinase 7 (NEK7) is essential for inflammasome activation, and its interaction with NLRP3 is enhanced by K+ efflux. However, the mechanism by which K+ efflux promotes this interaction remains unknown. Here, we show that NEK7 is rapidly phosphorylated at threonine-190/191 by JNK1 downstream of K+ efflux and gasdermin D (GSDMD) after NLRP3 activation. NEK7 phosphorylation enhances the binding between NEK7 and NLRP3, which further promotes inflammasome assembly and activation. Mutant mice and macrophages in which Thr190 and Thr191 of Nek7 were replaced by valine exhibited impaired NEK7 phosphorylation, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and IL-1β secretion. Thus, NEK7 phosphorylation is an important event that acts downstream of K+ efflux and GSDMD to further enhance NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the deadliest solid cancers; thus, identifying more effective therapies is a major unmet need. In this study, we characterized the super enhancer (SE) landscape of human PDAC to identify drivers of the disease that might be targetable. This analysis revealed MICAL2 as a super enhancer-associated gene in human PDAC, which encodes the flavin monooxygenase MICAL2 that induces actin depolymerization and indirectly promotes SRF transcription by modulating the availability of serum response factor coactivators myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTF-A and MRTF-B). MICAL2 was overexpressed in PDAC, and high MICAL2 expression correlated with poor patient prognosis. Transcriptional analysis revealed that MICAL2 upregulates KRAS and EMT signaling pathways, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis. In loss and gain of function experiments in human and mouse PDAC cells, MICAL2 promoted both ERK1/2 and AKT activation. Consistent with its role in actin depolymerization and KRAS signaling, loss of MICAL2 also inhibited macropinocytosis. MICAL2, MRTF-A, and MRTF-B influenced PDAC cell proliferation and migration and promoted cell cycle progression in vitro. Importantly, MICAL2 supported in vivo tumor growth and metastasis. Interestingly, MRTF-B, but not MRTF-A, phenocopied MICAL2-driven phenotypes in vivo. This study highlights the multiple ways in which MICAL2 impacts PDAC biology and provides a foundation for future investigations into the potential of targeting MICAL2 for therapeutic intervention.

abstract: Psychotherapeutic treatment of adolescents requires age-specific approaches and thus plausibly also involves different change mechanisms than adult psychotherapy. To guide further research and improve therapeutic outcomes for adolescents, we reviewed all RCTs investigating mechanisms of change in the psychological treatment of adolescents to identify the most promising age-, disorder- or treatment-specific mediators. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews (PRISMA), 106 studies were included that reported 252 statistical mediation tests assessed with 181 different measures. Most often studied and significant mediators were cognitive, followed by family-related, and behavioral variables. Several mediators were identified to be promising for future investigations: changes in negative thoughts, dysfunctional beliefs and metacognitive skills; family functioning and parenting skills; as well as successful engagement in therapy activities and increased impulse control. Symptom change during therapy was least often a mediator for other therapeutic changes. Relational and emotional mediators were largely understudied, whereas peer-influence appeared a promising mediator for intervention outcomes. Adolescence-specific mediators were most commonly investigated. Majority of studied mediators were not disorder-specific. There was a tendency to mainly test change mechanisms of specific theoretical models without considering other possible change theories. Further, virtually no studies fulfilled all criteria for rigorously investigating mediation and only nine were classified with an overall good study quality. While bearing in mind the current limitations in study designs, methodological rigor and reporting, there appears to be substantial evidence for transdiagnostic age-specific change models in the psychological treatment of adolescents. For future research, need for consensus on a core set of transdiagnostic and transtheoretical mediators and measures is highlighted. These should address likely core mechanisms of change, as well as take into account age-relevant developmental challenges and biological markers.

abstract: New treatment approaches are warranted for patients with advanced melanoma refractory to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) or BRAF-targeted therapy. We designed BNT221, a personalized, neoantigen-specific autologous T cell product derived from peripheral blood, and tested this in a 3 + 3 dose-finding study with two dose levels (DLs) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, disease progression after ICB, measurable disease (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1) and, where appropriate, BRAF-targeted therapy. Primary and secondary objectives were evaluation of safety, highest tolerated dose and anti-tumor activity. We report here the non-pre-specified, final results of the completed monotherapy arm consisting of nine patients: three at DL1 (1 × 108-1 × 109 cells) and six at DL2 (2 × 109-1 × 1010 cells). Drug products (DPs) were generated for all enrolled patients. BNT221 was well tolerated across both DLs, with no dose-limiting toxicities of grade 3 or higher attributed to the T cell product observed. Specifically, no cytokine release, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity or macrophage activation syndromes were reported. A dose of 5.0 × 108-1.0 × 1010 cells was identified for further study conduct. Six patients showed stable disease as best overall response, and tumor reductions (≤20%) were reported for four of these patients. In exploratory analyses, multiple mutant-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were generated in each DP. These were cytotoxic, polyfunctional and expressed T cell receptors with broad functional avidities. Neoantigen-specific clonotypes were detected after treatment in blood and tumor. Our results provide key insights into this neoantigen-specific adoptive T cell therapy and demonstrate proof of concept for this new therapeutic approach.

abstract: The BMT CTN 1703 phase III trial confirmed that graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy), tacrolimus (Tac), and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) results in superior GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) compared with Tac/methotrexate (MTX) prophylaxis. This companion study assesses the effect of these regimens on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Using the Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Score and PROMIS subscales (physical function, GI symptoms, social role satisfaction) as primary end points and hemorrhagic cystitis symptoms and Lee subscales as secondary end points, responses from English and Spanish speakers were analyzed at baseline and days 100, 180, and 365 after transplant. PRO scores were compared between the arms using inverse probability weighted-independent estimating equation models. The PTCy arm had significantly lower scores on the Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale (P = .01), indicating lower GVHD symptom burden. Lee Scale nutrition and mouth subscores were also better in the PTCy arm compared with the Tac/MTX arm (P < .01 for both). Older participants (age >65 years) reported better Lee Scale psychological subscores than younger participants (P = .003). No significant differences were identified in hemorrhagic cystitis or in the PROMIS subscales between treatment arms. The updated clinical end points at 2 years for the parent trial confirmed that PTCy/Tac/MMF maintained a significant advantage over Tac/MTX in GRFS (42.4% v 28.8%, P = .001). In addition to improved GRFS, patients randomly assigned to the PTCy arm reported lower symptom burden during the first year after transplant.

abstract: For any organism, survival is enhanced by the ability to sense and respond to threats in advance. For bacteria, danger sensing among kin cells has been observed, but the presence or impacts of general danger signals are poorly understood. Here we show that different bacterial species use exogenous peptidoglycan fragments, which are released by nearby kin or non-kin cell lysis, as a general danger signal. Using microscopy and gene expression profiling of Vibrio cholerae, we find that even brief signal exposure results in a regulatory response that causes three-dimensional biofilm formation, which protects cells from a broad range of stresses, including bacteriophage predation. A diverse set of species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) also respond to exogenous peptidoglycan by forming biofilms. As peptidoglycan from different Gram-negative and Gram-positive species triggered three-dimensional biofilm formation, we propose that this danger signal and danger response are conserved among bacteria.

abstract: Stem cells reside in specialized microenvironments, termed niches, at several different locations in tissues1-3. The differential functions of heterogeneous stem cells and niches are important given the increasing clinical applications of stem-cell transplantation and immunotherapy. Whether hierarchical structures among stem cells at distinct niches exist and further control aspects of immune tolerance is unknown. Here we describe previously unknown new hierarchical arrangements in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and bone marrow niches that dictate both regenerative potential and immune privilege. High-level nitric oxide-generating (NOhi) HSCs are refractory to immune attack and exhibit delayed albeit robust long-term reconstitution. Such highly immune-privileged, primitive NOhi HSCs co-localize with distinctive capillaries characterized by primary ciliated endothelium and high levels of the immune-checkpoint molecule CD200. These capillaries regulate the regenerative functions of NOhi HSCs through the ciliary protein IFT20 together with CD200, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and autophagy signals, which further mediate immunoprotection. Notably, previously described niche constituents, sinusoidal cells and type-H vessels2-10 co-localize with less immune-privileged and less potent NOlow HSCs. Together, we identify highly immune-privileged, late-rising primitive HSCs and characterize their immunoprotective niches comprising specialized vascular domains. Our results indicate that the niche orchestrates hierarchy in stem cells and immune tolerance, and highlight future immunotherapeutic targets.

abstract: Disseminated cancer cells in the peritoneal fluid often colonize omental fat-associated lymphoid clusters but the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we identify that innate-like B cells accumulate in the omentum of mice and women with early-stage ovarian cancer concomitantly with the extrusion of chromatin fibers by neutrophils called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Studies using genetically modified NET-deficient mice, pharmacologic inhibition of NETs, and adoptive B cell transfer show that NETs induce expression of the chemoattractant CXCL13 in the pre-metastatic omentum, stimulating recruitment of peritoneal innate-like B cells that in turn promote expansion of regulatory T cells and omental metastasis through producing interleukin (IL)-10. Ex vivo studies show that NETs elicit IL-10 production in innate-like B cells by inactivating SHP-1, a phosphatase that inhibits B cell activation pathways, and by generating reactive oxygen species. These findings reveal that NETs alter immune cell dynamics in the pre-metastatic omentum, rendering this niche conducive for colonization.

abstract: Lactate-mediated lactylation on target proteins is recently identified as the novel posttranslational modification with profound biological functions. RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modification possesses dynamic and reversible nature, suggesting that activity of its methyltransferase NSUN2 is actively regulated. However, how NSUN2 activity is response to acidic condition in tumor microenvironment and then regulates cancer cell survival remain to be clarified. Here, we demonstrate that NSUN2 activity is enhanced by lactate-mediated lactylation at lysine 508, which then targets glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) mRNA to facilitates GCLC m5C formation and mRNA stabilization. The activated GCLC induces higher level of intracellular GSH accompanied by decreased lipid peroxidation and resistant phenotype to ferroptosis induction by doxorubicin (Dox) in gastric cancer cells. Specifically, the effect of NSUN2 lactylation-GCLC-GSH pathway is nearly lost when NSUN2 K508R or GCLC C-A mutant (five cytosine sites) was introduced into the cancer cells. We further identify the catalytic subunit N-α-acetyltransferase 10 (NAA10) as the lactytransferase of NSUN2, and lactate treatment substantially enhances their association and consequent NSUN2 activation. Taken together, our findings convincingly elucidate the signaling axis of NAA10-NSUN2-GCLC that potently antagonizes the ferroptosis under acidic condition, and therefore, targeting NSUN2 lactylation might be an effective strategy in improving the prognosis of cancer patients.

abstract: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) drive metastasis, the leading cause of death in individuals with breast cancer. Due to their low abundance in the circulation, robust CTC expansion protocols are urgently needed to effectively study disease progression and therapy responses. Here we present the establishment of long-term CTC-derived organoids from female individuals with metastatic breast cancer. Multiomics analysis of CTC-derived organoids along with preclinical modeling with xenografts identified neuregulin 1 (NRG1)-ERBB2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ERBB3/HER3) signaling as a key pathway required for CTC survival, growth and dissemination. Genome-wide CRISPR activation screens revealed that fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling serves a compensatory function to the NRG1-HER3 axis and rescues NRG1 deficiency in CTCs. Conversely, NRG1-HER3 activation induced resistance to FGFR1 inhibition, whereas combinatorial blockade impaired CTC growth. The dynamic interplay between NRG1-HER3 and FGFR1 signaling reveals the molecular basis of cancer cell plasticity and clinically relevant strategies to target it. Our CTC organoid platform enables the identification and validation of patient-specific vulnerabilities and represents an innovative tool for precision medicine.

abstract: Obesity and type 2 diabetes are prevalent chronic diseases effectively managed by semaglutide. Here we studied the effects of semaglutide on the circulating proteome using baseline and end-of-treatment serum samples from two phase 3 trials in participants with overweight or obesity, with or without diabetes: STEP 1 (n = 1,311) and STEP 2 (n = 645). We identified evidence supporting broad effects of semaglutide, implicating processes related to body weight regulation, glycemic control, lipid metabolism and inflammatory pathways. Several proteins were regulated with semaglutide, after accounting for changes in body weight and HbA1c at end of trial, suggesting effects of semaglutide on the proteome beyond weight loss and glucose lowering. A comparison of semaglutide with real-world proteomic profiles revealed potential benefits on disease-specific proteomic signatures including the downregulation of specific proteins associated with cardiovascular disease risk, supporting its reported effects of lowering cardiovascular disease risk and potential drug repurposing opportunities. This study showcases the potential of proteomics data gathered from randomized trials for providing insights into disease mechanisms and drug repurposing opportunities. These data also highlight the unmet need for, and importance of, examining proteomic changes in response to weight loss pharmacotherapy in future trials.

abstract: Cerebral cortex development in humans is a highly complex and orchestrated process that is under tight genetic regulation. Rare mutations that alter gene expression or function can disrupt the structure of the cerebral cortex, resulting in a range of neurological conditions1. Lissencephaly ('smooth brain') spectrum disorders comprise a group of rare, genetically heterogeneous congenital brain malformations commonly associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability2. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis remain unknown. Here we establish hypoactivity of the mTOR pathway as a clinically relevant molecular mechanism in lissencephaly spectrum disorders. We characterized two types of cerebral organoid derived from individuals with genetically distinct lissencephalies with a recessive mutation in p53-induced death domain protein 1 (PIDD1) or a heterozygous chromosome 17p13.3 microdeletion leading to Miller-Dieker lissencephaly syndrome (MDLS). PIDD1-mutant organoids and MDLS organoids recapitulated the thickened cortex typical of human lissencephaly and demonstrated dysregulation of protein translation, metabolism and the mTOR pathway. A brain-selective activator of mTOR complex 1 prevented and reversed cellular and molecular defects in the lissencephaly organoids. Our findings show that a converging molecular mechanism contributes to two genetically distinct lissencephaly spectrum disorders.

abstract: CD226 plays a vital role in natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, interacting with its ligands CD112 and CD155 to initiate immune synapse formation, primarily through leukocyte function-associated-1 (LFA-1). Our study examined the role of CD226 in NK cell surveillance of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). NK cells in patients with AML had lower expression of CD226. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of CD226 led to reduced LFA-1 recruitment, poor synapse formation, and decreased NK cell anti-leukemic activity. Engineering NK cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor targeting the AML antigen CD38 (CAR38) could overcome the need for CD226 to establish strong immune synapses. LFA-1 blockade reduced CAR38 NK cell activity, and this depended on the CD38 expression levels of AML cells. This suggests parallel but potentially cooperative roles for LFA-1 and CAR38 in synapse formation. Our findings suggest that CAR38 NK cells could be an effective therapeutic strategy to overcome CD226-mediated immune evasion in AML.

abstract: Lysosomes are the major cellular organelles responsible for nutrient recycling and degradation of cellular material. Maintenance of lysosomal integrity is essential for cellular homeostasis and lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) sensitizes toward cell death. Damaged lysosomes are repaired or degraded via lysophagy, during which glycans, exposed on ruptured lysosomal membranes, are recognized by galectins leading to K48- and K63-linked poly-ubiquitination (poly-Ub) of lysosomal proteins followed by recruitment of the macroautophagic/autophagic machinery and degradation. Linear (M1) poly-Ub, catalyzed by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) E3 ligase and removed by OTULIN (OTU deubiquitinase with linear linkage specificity) exerts important functions in immune signaling and cell survival, but the role of M1 poly-Ub in lysosomal homeostasis remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that L-leucyl-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe)-damaged lysosomes accumulate M1 poly-Ub in an OTULIN- and K63 Ub-dependent manner. LMP-induced M1 poly-Ub at damaged lysosomes contributes to lysosome degradation, recruits the NFKB (nuclear factor kappa B) modulator IKBKG/NEMO and locally activates the inhibitor of NFKB kinase (IKK) complex to trigger NFKB activation. Inhibition of lysosomal degradation enhances LMP- and OTULIN-regulated cell death, indicating pro-survival functions of M1 poly-Ub during LMP and potentially lysophagy. Finally, we demonstrate that M1 poly-Ub also occurs at damaged lysosomes in primary mouse neurons and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived primary human dopaminergic neurons. Our results reveal novel functions of M1 poly-Ub during lysosomal homeostasis, LMP and degradation of damaged lysosomes, with important implications for NFKB signaling, inflammation and cell death.Abbreviation: ATG: autophagy related; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; CALCOCO2/NDP52: calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2; CRISPR: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats; CHUK/IKKA: component of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase complex; CUL4A-DDB1-WDFY1: cullin 4A-damage specific DNA binding protein 1-WD repeat and FYVE domain containing 1; DGCs: degradative compartments; DIV: days in vitro; DUB: deubiquitinase/deubiquitinating enzyme; ELDR: endo-lysosomal damage response; ESCRT: endosomal sorting complex required for transport; FBXO27: F-box protein 27; GBM: glioblastoma multiforme; IKBKB/IKKB: inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit beta; IKBKG/NEMO: inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase regulatory subunit gamma; IKK: inhibitor of NFKB kinase; iPSC: induced pluripotent stem cell; KBTBD7: kelch repeat and BTB domain containing 7; KO: knockout; LAMP1: lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; LCD: lysosomal cell death; LGALS: galectin; LMP: lysosomal membrane permeabilization; LLOMe: L-leucyl-leucine methyl ester; LOP: loperamide; LUBAC: linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex; LRSAM1: leucine rich repeat and sterile alpha motif containing 1; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MTORC1: MTOR complex 1; NBR1: NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor; NFKB/NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa B; NFKBIA/IĸBα: nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor alpha; OPTN: optineurin; ORAS: OTULIN-related autoinflammatory syndrome; OTULIN: OTU deubiquitinase with linear linkage specificity; RING: really interesting new gene; RBR: RING-in-between-RING; PLAA: phospholipase A2 activating protein; RBCK1/HOIL-1: RANBP2-type and C3HC4-type zinc finger containing 1; RNF31/HOIP: ring finger protein 31; SHARPIN: SHANK associated RH domain interactor; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; SR-SIM: super-resolution-structured illumination microscopy; TAX1BP1: Tax1 binding protein 1; TBK1: TANK binding kinase 1; TH: tyrosine hydroxylase; TNF/TNFα: tumor necrosis factor; TNFRSF1A/TNFR1-SC: TNF receptor superfamily member 1A signaling complex; TRIM16: tripartite motif containing 16; Ub: ubiquitin; UBE2QL1: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 QL1; UBXN6/UBXD1: UBX domain protein 6; VCP/p97: valosin containing protein; WIPI2: WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting 2; YOD1: YOD1 deubiquitinase.

abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) presents a substantial clinical challenge due to the limited understanding of its genetic underpinnings. Here we conduct the largest scale whole-exome sequencing association study of NPC to date, encompassing 6,969 NPC cases and 7,100 controls. We unveil 3 germline genetic variants linked to NPC susceptibility: a common rs2276868 in RPL14, a rare rs5361 in SELE, and a common rs1050462 in HLA-B. We also underscore the critical impact of rare genetic variants on NPC heritability and introduce a refined composite polygenic risk score (rcPRS), which outperforms existing models in predicting NPC risk. Importantly, we reveal that the polygenic risk for NPC is mediated by EBV infection status. Utilizing a comprehensive multiomics approach that integrates both bulk-transcriptomic (n = 356) and single-cell RNA sequencing (n = 56) data with experimental validations, we demonstrate that the RPL14 variant modulates the EBV life cycle and NPC pathogenesis. Furthermore, our data indicate that the SELE variant contributes to modifying endothelial cell function, thereby facilitating NPC progression. Collectively, our study provides crucial insights into the intricate genetic architecture of NPC, spotlighting the vital interplay between genetic variations and tumor microenvironment components, including EBV and endothelial cells, in predisposing to NPC. This study opens new avenues for advancements in personalized risk assessments, early diagnosis, and targeted therapies for NPC.

abstract: Inborn errors of selenoprotein expression arise from deleterious variants in genes encoding selenoproteins or selenoprotein biosynthetic factors, some of which are associated with neurodegenerative disorders. This study shows that bi-allelic selenocysteine tRNA-specific eukaryotic elongation factor (EEFSEC) variants cause selenoprotein deficiency, leading to progressive neurodegeneration. EEFSEC deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder, manifests with global developmental delay, progressive spasticity, ataxia, and seizures. Cerebral MRI primarily demonstrated a cerebellar pathology, including hypoplasia and progressive atrophy. Exome or genome sequencing identified six different bi-allelic EEFSEC variants in nine individuals from eight unrelated families. These variants showed reduced EEFSEC function in vitro, leading to lower levels of selenoproteins in fibroblasts. In line with the clinical phenotype, an eEFSec-RNAi Drosophila model displays progressive impairment of motor function, which is reflected in the synaptic defects in this model organisms. This study identifies EEFSEC deficiency as an inborn error of selenocysteine metabolism. It reveals the pathophysiological mechanisms of neurodegeneration linked to selenoprotein metabolism, suggesting potential targeted therapies.

abstract: Energy deprivation and metabolic rewiring of cardiomyocytes are widely recognized hallmarks of heart failure. Here, we report that HEY2 (a Hairy/Enhancer-of-split-related transcriptional repressor) is upregulated in hearts of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Induced Hey2 expression in zebrafish hearts or mammalian cardiomyocytes impairs mitochondrial respiration, accompanied by elevated ROS, resulting in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and heart failure. Conversely, Hey2 depletion in adult mouse hearts and zebrafish enhances the expression of mitochondrial oxidation genes and cardiac function. Multifaceted genome-wide analyses reveal that HEY2 enriches at the promoters of genes known to regulate metabolism (including Ppargc1, Esrra and Cpt1) and colocalizes with HDAC1 to effectuate histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression. Consequently, restoration of PPARGC1A/ESRRA in Hey2- overexpressing zebrafish hearts or human cardiomyocyte-like cells rescues deficits in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Knockdown of Hey2 in adult mouse hearts protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction. These studies reveal an evolutionarily conserved HEY2/HDAC1-Ppargc1/Cpt transcriptional module that controls energy metabolism to preserve cardiac function.

abstract: The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a highly conserved protein complex in eukaryotes, with CSN5 serving as its critical catalytic subunit. However, the role of CSN5 in plant immunity is largely unexplored. Here, we found that suppression of OsCSN5 in rice enhances resistance against the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae and the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) without affecting growth. OsCSN5 is ubiquitinated and degraded by the E3 ligase OsPUB45. Overexpression of OsPUB45 increased resistance against M. oryzae and Xoo, while dysfunction of OsPUB45 decreased resistance. In addition, OsCSN5 stabilized OsCUL3a to promote the degradation of a positive regulator OsNPR1. Overexpression of OsPUB45 compromised accumulation of OsCUL3a, leading to stabilization of OsNPR1, whereas mutations in OsPUB45 destabilized OsNPR1. These findings suggest that OsCSN5 stabilizes OsCUL3a to facilitate the degradation of OsNPR1, preventing its constitutive activation without infection. Conversely, OsPUB45 promotes the degradation of OsCSN5, contributing to immunity activation upon pathogen infection.

abstract: Mitochondrial dysfunction is a crucial event in acute kidney injury (AKI), leading to a metabolic shift toward glycolysis and increased lactate production. Lactylation, a posttranslational modification derived from lactate, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, yet its implications in AKI remain underexplored. Here, a marked increase in lactate levels and pan-Kla levels are observed in kidney tissue from AKI patients and mice, with pronounced lactylation activity in injured proximal tubular cells identified by single-cell RNA sequencing. The lactylation of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is identified at lysine 52 (K52la), revealing that ALDH2 lactylation exacerbates tubular injury and mitochondrial dysfunction. Conversely, the ALDH2 K52R mutation alleviates these injuries in HK-2 cells and adeno-associated virus-infected kidney tissues in mice. Furthermore, ALDH2 lactylation can be modulated by upregulating SIRT3 in vivo and in vitro, which reduces ALDH2 lactylation, mitigating tubular injury and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanistically, immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry analysis demonstrates an interaction between ALDH2 and prohibitin 2 (PHB2), a crucial mitophagy receptor. ALDH2 lactylation promotes the ubiquitination-proteasomal degradation of PHB2 to inhibit mitophagy and worsen mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings highlight the critical role of endogenous lactate in AKI and propose ALDH2 lactylation as a potential therapeutic target.

abstract: Suppression of chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T) cells by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment remains a major barrier to their efficacy against solid tumors. To address this, we develop an anti-PD-L1-expressing nanovesicle loaded with the STING agonist cGAMP (aPD-L1 NVs@cGAMP) to remodel the tumor microenvironment and thereby enhance CAR-T cell activity. Following pulmonary delivery, the nanovesicles rapidly accumulate in the lung and selectively deliver STING agonists to PD-L1-overexpressing cells via the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. This targeted delivery effectively avoids the systemic inflammation and poor cellular uptake that plague free STING agonists. Internalized STING agonists trigger STING signaling and induce interferon responses, which diminish immunosuppressive cell populations such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment and promote CAR-T cell infiltration. Importantly, the anti-PD-L1 single chain variable fragment on the nanovesicle surface blocks PD-L1 upregulation induced by STING agonists and prevents CAR-T cell exhaustion. In both orthotopic lung cancer and lung metastasis model, combined therapy with CAR-T cells and aPD-L1 NVs@cGAMP potently inhibits tumor growth and prevents recurrence. Therefore, aPD-L1 NVs@cGAMP is expected to serve as an effective CAR-T cell enhancer to improve the efficacy of CAR-T cells against solid tumors.

abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease accompanied with the loss of cartilage and consequent nociceptive symptoms. Normal articular cartilage maintains at aneural state. Neuron guidance factor Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is a membrane-associated secreted protein with chemorepulsive properties for axons. However, the role of Sema3A in articular cartilage is still not clear. In the present studies, we investigated the functions of Sema3A in OA development in mice, non-human primates, and patients with OA. Sema3A has a protective effect on cartilage degradation, validated by the organoid culture in vitro and confirmed in chondrocyte-specific Sema3A conditional knockout mice. We demonstrated that Sema3A is a key molecule in maintaining cartilage homeostasis from chondrocyte hypertrophy via activating the PI3K pathway. The potential usage of Sema3A for OA treatment was validated in mouse and Rhesus macaque OA models through intra-articular injection of Sema3A, and also in patients by administering Sema3A containing platelet-rich plasma into the knee joints. Our studies demonstrated that Sema3A exerts a critical role in inhibiting neurite ingrowth and preventing chondrocyte hypertrophy in cartilage, and could be potentially used for OA treatment.

abstract: The tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC) often follows the normal-adenoma-carcinoma (N-A-C) sequence. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying colorectal adenoma carcinogenesis remain largely unknown. Here, we analyzed transcriptomic profile changes in normal, advanced adenoma, and carcinoma tissues from patients with CRC, revealing that glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 1 (GPT1) in colorectal tissues was down-regulated during the N-A-C process and correlated with poor CRC prognosis. Mechanistically, GPT1 was transcriptionally activated by Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). GPT1 reprogrammed metabolism and suppressed CRC tumorigenesis in cells and mouse models not only through enzyme-dependent α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) production and WNT signaling inhibition but also through enzyme-independent disruption of the folate cycle through binding with methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1-like (MTHFD1L). Furthermore, we identified poliumoside as a GPT1 activator that restrained CRC progression in cells, patient-derived CRC organoids, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of CRC. Our study uncovers a role for GPT1 in CRC tumorigenesis and shows that poliumoside is a potential drug for the prevention and treatment of CRC.

abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is known to be a major complication of systemic sclerosis (SSc) and a leading cause of death in SSc patients. As the most common type of ILD, the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has not been fully elucidated. In this study, weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), protein‒protein interaction, Kaplan-Meier curve, univariate Cox analysis and machine learning methods were used on datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. CCL2 was identified as a common characteristic gene of IPF and SSc. The genes associated with CCL2 expression in both diseases were enriched mainly in chemokine-related pathways and lipid metabolism-related pathways according to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) revealed a significant difference in CCL2 expression in alveolar epithelial type 1/2 cells, mast cells, ciliated cells, club cells, fibroblasts, M1/M2 macrophages, monocytes and plasma cells between IPF patients and healthy donors. Statistical analyses revealed that CCL2 was negatively correlated with lung function in IPF patients and decreased after mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) treatment in SSc patients. Finally, we identified CCL2 as a common biomarker from IPF and SSc, revealing the common mechanism of these two diseases and providing clues for the study of the treatment and mechanism of these two diseases.

abstract: Accumulating evidence indicates that cellular senescence is closely associated with osteoarthritis. However, there is limited research on the mechanisms underlying fibroblast-like synoviocyte senescence and its impact on osteoarthritis progression. Here, we elucidate a positive correlation between fibroblast-like synoviocyte senescence and osteoarthritis progression and reveal that GATD3A deficiency induces fibroblast-like synoviocyte senescence. Mechanistically, GATD3A deficiency enhances the binding of Sirt3 to MDH2, leading to deacetylation and decreased activity of MDH2. Reduced MDH2 activity impairs tricarboxylic acid cycle flux, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and fibroblast-like synoviocyte senescence. Intra-articular injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying GATD3A significantly alleviates the osteoarthritis phenotype in male mice. This study increases our current understanding of GATD3A function. In particular, we reveal a novel mechanism of fibroblast-like synoviocyte senescence, suggesting that targeting GATD3A is a potential therapeutic approach for osteoarthritis.

abstract: The protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network encompasses a myriad of mechanisms that maintain the integrity of the proteome by controlling various biological functions, including protein folding and degradation. Alas, ageing-associated decline in the efficiency of this network enables protein aggregation and consequently the development of late-onset neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Accordingly, the maintenance of proteostasis through late stages of life bears the promise to delay the emergence of these devastating diseases. Yet the identification of proteostasis regulators is needed to assess the feasibility of this approach. Here we report that knocking down the activity of the nucleolar FIB-1-NOL-56 complex protects model nematodes from proteotoxicity of the Alzheimer's disease-causing amyloid-β peptide and of abnormally long poly-glutamine stretches. This mechanism promotes proteostasis across tissues by modulating the activity of TGFβ signalling and by enhancing proteasome activity. Our findings point at research avenues towards the development of proteostasis-promoting therapies for neurodegenerative maladies.

abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-mediated protein S-sulfhydration has been shown to play critical roles in several diseases. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the predominant population of immune cells present within solid tumor tissues, and they function to restrict antitumor immunity. However, no previous study has investigated the role of protein S-sulfhydration in TAM reprogramming in breast cancer (BC). Therefore, the aim is to investigate whether protein S-sulfhydration can regulate TAM reprogramming and its underlying mechanism in BC. The results showed that in BC, the CTH-H2S axis is positively correlated with the presence of an anti-tumor phenotype in TAMs. NaHS, as an H2S donor, repolarized TAMs into M1 macrophages to block the tumor-promoting activities of TAMs both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, H2S-mediated S-sulfhydration of the protein chaperone glucose-regulated-protein 78 (GRP78) induced endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein kinase-1α (IRE-1α) dissociation from GRP78, which enhanced the phosphatase activity of IRE-1α itself in BC-TAMs, while the Cys420 site mutation of GRP78 interfered with these effects. Collectively, GRP78 S-sulfhydrylation mediated by H2S at the Cys420 residue decreased the tumor burden and inhibited lung metastasis of BC through reprograming TAMs via activating the IRE-1α pathway, indicating that targeting GRP78 S-sulfhydration represents a promising intervention for TAM-M1 repolarization in BC.

abstract: Aging, a universal and inevitable process, is characterized by a progressive accumulation of physiological alterations and functional decline over time, leading to increased vulnerability to diseases and ultimately mortality as age advances. Lifestyle factors, notably physical activity (PA) and exercise, significantly modulate aging phenotypes. Physical activity and exercise can prevent or ameliorate lifestyle-related diseases, extend health span, enhance physical function, and reduce the burden of non-communicable chronic diseases including cardiometabolic disease, cancer, musculoskeletal and neurological conditions, and chronic respiratory diseases as well as premature mortality. Physical activity influences the cellular and molecular drivers of biological aging, slowing aging rates-a foundational aspect of geroscience. Thus, PA serves both as preventive medicine and therapeutic agent in pathological states. Sub-optimal PA levels correlate with increased disease prevalence in aging populations. Structured exercise prescriptions should therefore be customized and monitored like any other medical treatment, considering the dose-response relationships and specific adaptations necessary for intended outcomes. Current guidelines recommend a multifaceted exercise regimen that includes aerobic, resistance, balance, and flexibility training through structured and incidental (integrated lifestyle) activities. Tailored exercise programs have proven effective in helping older adults maintain their functional capacities, extending their health span, and enhancing their quality of life. Particularly important are anabolic exercises, such as Progressive resistance training (PRT), which are indispensable for maintaining or improving functional capacity in older adults, particularly those with frailty, sarcopenia or osteoporosis, or those hospitalized or in residential aged care. Multicomponent exercise interventions that include cognitive tasks significantly enhance the hallmarks of frailty (low body mass, strength, mobility, PA level, and energy) and cognitive function, thus preventing falls and optimizing functional capacity during aging. Importantly, PA/exercise displays dose-response characteristics and varies between individuals, necessitating personalized modalities tailored to specific medical conditions. Precision in exercise prescriptions remains a significant area of further research, given the global impact of aging and broad effects of PA. Economic analyses underscore the cost benefits of exercise programs, justifying broader integration into health care for older adults. However, despite these benefits, exercise is far from fully integrated into medical practice for older people. Many healthcare professionals, including geriatricians, need more training to incorporate exercise directly into patient care, whether in settings including hospitals, outpatient clinics, or residential care. Education about the use of exercise as isolated or adjunctive treatment for geriatric syndromes and chronic diseases would do much to ease the problems of polypharmacy and widespread prescription of potentially inappropriate medications. This intersection of prescriptive practices and PA/exercise offers a promising approach to enhance the well-being of older adults. An integrated strategy that combines exercise prescriptions with pharmacotherapy would optimize the vitality and functional independence of older people whilst minimizing adverse drug reactions. This consensus provides the rationale for the integration of PA into health promotion, disease prevention, and management strategies for older adults. Guidelines are included for specific modalities and dosages of exercise with proven efficacy in randomized controlled trials. Descriptions of the beneficial physiological changes, attenuation of aging phenotypes, and role of exercise in chronic disease and disability management in older adults are provided. The use of exercise in cardiometabolic disease, cancer, musculoskeletal conditions, frailty, sarcopenia, and neuropsychological health is emphasized. Recommendations to bridge existing knowledge and implementation gaps and fully integrate PA into the mainstream of geriatric care are provided. Particular attention is paid to the need for personalized medicine as it applies to exercise and geroscience, given the inter-individual variability in adaptation to exercise demonstrated in older adult cohorts. Overall, this consensus provides a foundation for applying and extending the current knowledge base of exercise as medicine for an aging population to optimize health span and quality of life.

abstract: Mitochondrial function is modulated by its interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Recent research indicates that these contacts are disrupted in familial models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We report here that this impairment in the crosstalk between mitochondria and the ER impedes the use of glucose-derived pyruvate as mitochondrial fuel, causing a shift to fatty acids to sustain energy production. Over time, this deficiency alters mitochondrial electron flow and the active/dormant status of complex I in spinal cord tissues, but not in the brain. These findings suggest mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM domains) play a crucial role in regulating cellular glucose metabolism and that MAM dysfunction may underlie the bioenergetic deficits observed in ALS.

abstract: The most advanced monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines against malaria target the central repeat region or closely related sequences within the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP). Here, using an antigen-agnostic strategy to investigate human antibody responses to whole sporozoites, we identified a class of mAbs that target a cryptic PfCSP epitope that is only exposed after cleavage and subsequent pyroglutamylation (pGlu) of the newly formed N terminus. This pGlu-CSP epitope is not targeted by current anti-PfCSP mAbs and is not included in the licensed malaria vaccines. MAD21-101, the most potent mAb in this class, confers sterile protection against Pf infection in a human liver-chimeric mouse model. These findings reveal a site of vulnerability on the sporozoite surface that can be targeted by next-generation antimalarial interventions.

abstract: This study updates the disease burden of multiple myeloma (MM) in thirty-three provincial administrative units in China from 1990 to 2021 and forecast the disease burden for 2050. Data from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database was used for analysis. In 2021, there were an estimated 17,250 new MM cases and 12,984 deaths in China. The age-standardized incidence, mortality, and prevalence rates per 100,000 population were 0.8, 0.6, and 2.2, respectively. The highest disease burden was observed in provinces with the highest per capita GDP. From 1990 to 2021, the age-standardized incidence and mortality increased by 3.1% and 2.2%, respectively, while prevalence increased disproportionately by 5.8%, reflecting improved treatment efficacy and extended patient survival. The age-standardized disability-adjusted life years rate increased by 2.2%. A more rapid rise in the disease burden was observed in younger populations compared to the elderly. In 2021, 5.5% of MM deaths were attributed to high body mass index. Over the past three decades, the MM burden in China has steadily increased. Forecasts for 2050 also indicated this upward trend will likely continue into the future. This study provided comprehensive estimates that can potentially inform efforts toward management of MM in China.

abstract: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive amyloid deposition and cognitive decline, yet the pathological mechanisms and treatments remain elusive. Here we report the therapeutic potential of low-intensity 40 hertz blue light exposure in a 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings reveal that light treatment prevents memory decline in 4-month-old 5xFAD mice and motivation loss in 14-month-old 5xFAD mice, accompanied by restoration of glial water channel aquaporin-4 polarity, improved brain drainage efficiency, and a reduction in hippocampal lipid accumulation. We further demonstrate the beneficial effects of 40 hertz blue light are mediated through the activation of the vLGN/IGL-Re visual circuit. Notably, concomitant use of anti-Aβ antibody with 40 hertz blue light demonstrates improved soluble Aβ clearance and cognitive performance in 5xFAD mice. These findings offer functional evidence on the therapeutic effects of 40 hertz blue light in Aβ-related pathologies and suggest its potential as a supplementary strategy to augment the efficacy of antibody-based therapy.

abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest human membrane protein family that transduce extracellular signals into cellular responses. They are major pharmacological targets, with approximately 26% of marketed drugs targeting GPCRs, primarily at their orthosteric binding site. Despite their prominence, predicting the pharmacological effects of novel GPCR-targeting drugs remains challenging due to the complex functional dynamics of these receptors. Recent advances in X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, spectroscopic techniques and molecular simulations have enhanced our understanding of receptor conformational dynamics and ligand interactions with GPCRs. These developments have revealed novel ligand-binding modes, mechanisms of action and druggable pockets. In this Review, we highlight such aspects for recently discovered small-molecule drugs and drug candidates targeting GPCRs, focusing on three categories: allosteric modulators, biased ligands, and bivalent and bitopic compounds. Although studies so far have largely been retrospective, integrating structural data on ligand-induced receptor functional dynamics into the drug discovery pipeline has the potential to guide the identification of drug candidates with specific abilities to modulate GPCR interactions with intracellular effector proteins such as G proteins and β-arrestins, enabling more tailored selectivity and efficacy profiles.

abstract: Starting with imatinib, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have turned chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) from a lethal blood cancer into a chronic condition. As patients with access to advanced CML care have an almost normal life expectancy, there is a perception that CML is a problem of the past, and one should direct research resources elsewhere. However, a closer look at the current CML landscape reveals a more nuanced picture. Most patients still require life-long TKI therapy to avoid recurrence of active CML. Chronic TKI toxicity and the high costs of the well-tolerated agents remain challenging. Progression to blast phase still occurs, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged parts of the world, where high risk CML at diagnosis is common. Here we will review the prospects of further improving TKIs to achieve optimal suppression of BCR::ABL1 kinase activity, the potential of combining different classes of TKIs, and the current state of BCR::ABL1 degraders. We will cover combination therapy approaches to address TKI resistance in the setting of residual leukemia and in advanced CML. Despite the unprecedented success of TKIs in CML, more work is needed to truly finish the job, and we hope to stimulate innovative research aiming to achieve this goal.

abstract: Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor inducing the development and progression of various diseases. Nicotine (NIC) is the major constituent of cigarette smoke. However, knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated stem cell functions is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in vivo and ex vivo. Moreover, NIC induces Yes-associated protein (YAP) /Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and Notch signaling in ISCs via α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) and protein kinase C (PKC) activation; this effect was not detected in Paneth cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine (DBZ) nullified the effects of NIC on ISCs. NIC enhances in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. Hence, this study identifies a NIC-triggered pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs and suggests the use of DBZ as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors.

abstract: Mutations in the ANXA11 gene, encoding an RNA-binding protein, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the underlying in vivo mechanisms remain unclear. This study examines the clinical features of ALS patients harboring the ANXA11 hotspot mutation p.P36R, characterized by late-onset motor neuron disease and occasional multi-system involvement. To elucidate the pathogenesis, we developed a knock-in mouse model carrying the p.P36R mutation. In both heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice, ANXA11 protein levels were comparable to those in wild-type. Both groups exhibited late-onset motor dysfunction at approximately 10 months of age, with similar survival rates to wild-type (> 24 months) and no signs of dementia. Pathological analysis revealed early abnormal aggregates in spinal cord motor neurons, cortical neurons, and muscle cells of homozygous mice. From 2 months of age, we observed mislocalized ANXA11 aggregates, SQSTM1/p62-positive inclusions, and cytoplasmic TDP-43 mislocalization, which intensified with disease progression. Importantly, mutant ANXA11 co-aggregated with TDP-43 and SQSTM1/p62-positive inclusions. Electron microscopy of the gastrocnemius muscle uncovered myofibrillar abnormalities, including sarcomeric disorganization, Z-disc dissolution, and subsarcolemmal electron-dense structures within autophagic vacuoles. Autophagic flux, initially intact at 2 months, was impaired by 9 months, as evidenced by decreased Beclin-1 and LC3BII/I levels and increased SQSTM1/p62 expression, coinciding with mTORC1 hyperactivation. Significant motor neuron loss and neuroinflammation were detected by 9 months, with marked muscle dystrophy apparent by 12 months compared to wild-type controls. These findings implicate the gain-of-function ANXA11 mutation drives late-onset motor neuron disease by early presymptomatic proteinopathy, progressive neuronal degeneration, neuroinflammation, and autophagic dysfunction.

abstract: Glucose metabolism has been studied extensively, but the role of glucose-derived excretory glycerol remains unclear. Here we show that hypoxia induces NADH accumulation to promote glycerol excretion and this pathway consumes NADH continuously, thus attenuating its accumulation and reductive stress. Aldolase B accounts for glycerol biosynthesis by forming a complex with glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenases GPD1 and GPD1L. Blocking GPD1, GPD1L or glycerol 3-phosphate phosphatase exacerbates reductive stress and suppresses cell proliferation under hypoxia and tumour growth in vivo. Overexpression of these enzymes increases glycerol excretion but still reduces cell viability under hypoxia and tumour proliferation due to energy stress. AMPK inactivates aldolase B to mitigate glycerol synthesis that dissipates ATP, alleviating NADH accumulation-induced energy crisis. Therefore, glycerol biosynthesis/excretion regulates the trade-off between reductive stress and energy stress. Moreover, this mode of regulation seems to be prevalent in reductive stress-driven transformations, enhancing our understanding of the metabolic complexity and guiding tumour treatment.

abstract: ASXL transcriptional regulator 1 (ASXL1) is one of the three most frequently mutated genes in age-related clonal hematopoiesis (CH), alongside DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A) and Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2). CH can progress to myeloid malignancies including chronic monomyelocytic leukemia (CMML) and is also strongly associated with inflammatory cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in humans. DNMT3A and TET2 regulate DNA methylation and demethylation pathways, respectively, and loss-of-function mutations in these genes reduce DNA methylation in heterochromatin, allowing derepression of silenced elements in heterochromatin. In contrast, the mechanisms that connect mutant ASXL1 and CH are not yet fully understood. CH/CMML-associated ASXL1 mutations encode C-terminally truncated proteins that enhance the deubiquitinase activity of the ASXL-BAP1 "PR-DUB" deubiquitinase complex, which removes monoubiquitin from H2AK119Ub. Here, we show that ASXL1 mutant proteins interact with the euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferases 1 and 2 (EHMT1-EHMT2) complex, which generates H3K9me1 and me2, the latter a repressive modification in constitutive heterochromatin. Compared to cells from age-matched wild-type mice, we found that expanded myeloid cells from old (≥18-mo-old) Asxl1tm/+ mice, a heterozygous knock-in mouse model of CH, display genome-wide decreases of H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and H2AK119Ub as well as an associated increase in expression of transposable elements (TEs) and satellite repeats. Increased TE expression was also observed in monocytes from ASXL1-mutant CMML patients compared to monocytes from healthy controls. Our data suggest that mutant ASXL1 proteins compromise the integrity of both constitutive and facultative heterochromatin in an age-dependent manner by reducing the levels of H3K9me2/3 and H2AK119Ub. This increase in TE expression correlated with increased expression of nearby genes, including many interferon-inducible (inflammation-associated) genes (ISGs).

abstract: The importance of SUMOylation in tumorigenesis has received increasing attention, and research on therapeutic agents targeting this pathway has progressed. However, the potential function of SUMOylation during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identified that SUMO-Specific Peptidase 3 (SENP3) was upregulated in HCC tissues and correlated with a poor prognosis. Multiple functional experiments demonstrated that SENP3 promotes the malignant phenotype of HCC cells. Mechanistically, SENP3 deSUMOylates RACK1 and subsequently increases its stability and interaction with PKCβII, thereby promoting eIF4E phosphorylation and translation of oncogenes, including Bcl2, Snail and Cyclin D1. Additionally, tumor-intrinsic SENP3 promotes the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) while reducing cytotoxic T cells to facilitate immune evasion. Mechanistically, SENP3 promotes translation of CCL20 via the RACK1 /eIF4E axis. Liver-specific knockdown of SENP3 significantly inhibits liver tumorigenesis in a chemically induced HCC model. SENP3 inhibition enhances the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1 blockade in an HCC mouse model. Collectively, SENP3 plays cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic roles in HCC progression and immune evasion by modulating oncogene and cytokine translation. Targeting SENP3 is a novel therapeutic target for boosting HCC responsiveness to immunotherapy.

abstract: Reproduction, development and homeostasis depend on motile cilia, whose rhythmic beating is powered by a microtubule-based molecular machine called the axoneme. Although an atomic model of the axoneme is available for the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii1, structures of mammalian axonemes are incomplete1-5. Furthermore, we do not fully understand how molecular structures of axonemes vary across motile-ciliated cell types in the body. Here we use cryoelectron microscopy, cryoelectron tomography and proteomics to resolve the 96-nm modular repeat of axonemal doublet microtubules (DMTs) from both sperm flagella and epithelial cilia of the oviduct, brain ventricles and respiratory tract. We find that sperm DMTs are the most specialized, with epithelial cilia having only minor differences across tissues. We build a model of the mammalian sperm DMT, defining the positions and interactions of 181 proteins including 34 newly identified proteins. We elucidate the composition of radial spoke 3 and uncover binding sites of kinases associated with regeneration of ATP and regulation of ciliary motility. We discover a sperm-specific, axoneme-tethered T-complex protein ring complex (TRiC) chaperone that may contribute to construction or maintenance of the long flagella of mammalian sperm. We resolve axonemal dyneins in their prestroke states, illuminating conformational changes that occur during ciliary movement. Our results illustrate how elements of chemical and mechanical regulation are embedded within the axoneme, providing valuable resources for understanding the aetiology of ciliopathy and infertility, and exemplifying the discovery power of modern structural biology.

Our recent study reported that scavenger receptor-A (SR-A) is a biomarker for RA, especially for anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP)-negative RA. Here, we further identified the B cell autoantigenic epitopes of SR-A. By a large-scale multicenter study including one training and three validation cohorts of 1954 participants, we showed that anticitrullinated SR-A peptide antibody (anti-CSP) was exclusively elevated in RA as a biomarker, particularly useful for seronegative RA. Combination of anti-CSP with anti-CCP demonstrated superior diagnostic value for RA, with sensitivity of 84.83% and specificity of 92.43%. Moreover, RA anti-CSP revealed distinct glycosylation patterns, capable of provoking inflammation in cartilage organoids and exacerbating disease progression in experimental arthritis. Together, these data identify anti-CSP as an RA autoantibody clinically applicable and actively involved in disease pathogenesis.

abstract: Background The systemic immunity-inflammation index(SII) is a new indicator of composite inflammatory response. Inflammatory response is an important pathological process in stroke. Therefore, this study sought to investigate the association between SII and stroke. Methods We collected data on participants with SII and stroke from the 2015-2020 cycle of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the cross-sectional investigation. Multivariate linear regression models were used to test the association between SII and stroke. Fitted smoothing curves and threshold effect analysis were applied to describe the nonlinear relationship. Results A total of 13,287 participants were included in our study, including 611 (4.598%) participants with stroke. In a multivariate linear regression analysis, we found a significant positive association between SII and stroke, and the odds ratio (OR) [95% CI] of SII associating with prevalence of stroke was [1.02 (1.01, 1.04)] (P < 0.01). In subgroup analysis and interaction experiments, we found that this positive relationship was not significantly correlated among different population settings such as age, gender, race, education level, smoking status, high blood pressure, diabetes and coronary heart disease (P for trend > 0.05). Moreover, we found an nonlinear relationship between SII and stroke with an inflection point of 740 (1,000 cells /µl) by using a two-segment linear regression model. Conclusions This study implies that increased SII levels are linked to stroke. To confirm our findings, more large-scale prospective investigations are needed.

abstract: The developmental competence and epigenetic progression of oocytes gradually become dysregulated with increasing maternal age. However, the mechanisms underlying age-related epigenetic regulation in oocytes remain poorly understood. Zygote arrest proteins 1 and 2 (ZAR1/2) are two maternal factors with partially redundant roles in maintaining oocyte quality, mainly known by regulating mRNA stability. In addition to this known function, it is found that ZAR1/2 is required for oocyte epigenetic maturation and zygotic reprogramming. Zar1/2-deleted oocytes exhibited reduced levels of multiple histone modifications and of the expression of corresponding histone modifiers, along with over-condensed chromatin, leading to compromised minor zygotic genome activation and deficient embryo development following fertilization. Cytoplasmic ZAR1/2 participated in intranuclear epigenetic maturation by binding the transcripts encoding histone modifiers and regulating their stability and translational activity. Moreover, oocytes from aged mice exhibited similar histone-modification deficiencies as the Zar1/2-deleted oocytes. ZAR1/2 mRNA and protein levels are downregulated in oocytes from mice and women with advanced ages, suggesting ZAR1/2 as regulators of epigenetic changes with reproductive aging. This study presents a new nucleo-cytoplasmic interaction mechanism that is involved in preventing oocyte epigenetic aging. Further, ZAR1/2 represents potential gene targets for diagnosis and clinical interventions in age-associated deficiencies in oocyte and embryo development.

abstract: Aims. Previous observational studies have provided inconsistent evidence for the association between serum iron status and the risk of gout. Moreover, it remains uncertain whether the observed association is causal or due to confounding or reverse causality. This research aimed to investigate the association of serum iron status indicators with the risk of gout and to further examine the causal relationship by the Mendelian randomization (MR) method. Methods. We first conducted a cross-sectional study from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2017-2018, including a total of 4635 participants. The association of serum iron status indicators with gout risk was evaluated using a multivariable logistic regression model. Furthermore, a two-sample MR study using genetic data from large-scale genome-wide association studies of serum iron status indicators (246 139 individuals) and gout (discovery: 13 179 cases and 75 0634 controls; replication: 5292 cases and 368 788 controls; 2115 cases and 67 259 controls) was conducted to infer causality. Inverse-variance-weighting (IVW) was applied as the main method of MR analysis. A series of sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate the robustness of their relationship. Results. In the cross-sectional study, there was no significant relationship between serum iron status indicators and gout risk. However, IVW results showed that genetically predicted serum iron and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were significantly associated with the increased risk of gout in the discovery analysis [odds ratio (OR): 1.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.32; P = 9.80 × 10-5 for serum iron and OR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.08-1.25; P = 7.14 × 10-5 for TSAT]. The replication analysis provided similar results compared with the discovery analysis. Conclusion. Our study provides support for potential causal associations between serum iron and the altered risk of gout. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the biological processes through which iron influences susceptibility to gout.

abstract: Transcription factors are frequent cancer driver genes, exhibiting noted specificity based on the precise cell of origin. We demonstrate that ZIC1 exhibits loss-of-function (LOF) somatic events in group 4 (G4) medulloblastoma through recurrent point mutations, subchromosomal deletions and mono-allelic epigenetic repression (60% of G4 medulloblastoma). In contrast, highly similar SHH medulloblastoma exhibits distinct and diametrically opposed gain-of-function mutations and copy number gains (20% of SHH medulloblastoma). Overexpression of ZIC1 suppresses the growth of group 3 medulloblastoma models, whereas it promotes the proliferation of SHH medulloblastoma precursor cells. SHH medulloblastoma ZIC1 mutants show increased activity versus wild-type ZIC1, whereas G4 medulloblastoma ZIC1 mutants exhibit LOF phenotypes. Distinct ZIC1 mutations affect cells of the rhombic lip in diametrically opposed ways, suggesting that ZIC1 is a critical developmental transcriptional regulator in both the normal and transformed rhombic lip and identifying ZIC1 as an exquisitely context-dependent driver gene in medulloblastoma.

abstract: Diagnosing lung cancer from indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPLs) remains challenging. In this multi-institutional study involving 2032 participants with IPLs, we integrate the clinical, radiomic with circulating cell-free DNA fragmentomic features in 5-methylcytosine (5mC)-enriched regions to establish a multiomics model (clinic-RadmC) for predicting the malignancy risk of IPLs. The clinic-RadmC yields an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.923 on the external test set, outperforming the single-omics models, and models that only combine clinical features with radiomic, or fragmentomic features in 5mC-enriched regions (p < 0.050 for all). The superiority of the clinic-RadmC maintains well even after adjusting for clinic-radiological variables. Furthermore, the clinic-RadmC-guided strategy could reduce the unnecessary invasive procedures for benign IPLs by 10.9% ~ 35%, and avoid the delayed treatment for lung cancer by 3.1% ~ 38.8%. In summary, our study indicates that the clinic-RadmC provides a more effective and noninvasive tool for optimizing lung cancer diagnoses, thus facilitating the precision interventions.

abstract: Pediatric solid tumors are a leading cause of childhood disease mortality. In this work, we examined germline structural variants (SVs) as risk factors for pediatric extracranial solid tumors using germline genome sequencing of 1765 affected children, their 943 unaffected parents, and 6665 adult controls. We discovered a sex-biased association between very large (>1 megabase) germline chromosomal abnormalities and increased risk of solid tumors in male children. The overall impact of germline SVs was greatest in neuroblastoma, where we uncovered burdens of ultrarare SVs that cause loss of function of highly expressed, mutationally constrained genes, as well as noncoding SVs predicted to disrupt chromatin domain boundaries. Collectively, we estimate that rare germline SVs explain 1.1 to 5.6% of pediatric cancer liability, establishing them as an important component of disease predisposition.

abstract: Inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) are genetic disorders that underlie susceptibility to infection, autoimmunity, autoinflammation, allergy and/or malignancy1. Incomplete penetrance is common among IEIs despite their monogenic basis2. Here we investigate the contribution of autosomal random monoallelic expression (aRMAE), a somatic commitment to the expression of one allele3,4, to phenotypic variability observed in families with IEIs. Using a clonal primary T cell system to assess aRMAE status of genes in healthy individuals, we find that 4.30% of IEI genes and 5.20% of all genes undergo aRMAE. Perturbing H3K27me3 and DNA methylation alters allele expression commitment, in support of two proposed mechanisms5,6 for the regulation of aRMAE. We tested peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with IEIs with shared genetic lesions but discordant clinical phenotypes for aRMAE. Among two relatives who were heterozygous for a mutation in PLCG2 (delEx19), an antibody deficiency phenotype corresponds to selective mutant allele expression in B cells. By contrast, among relatives who were heterozygous for a mutation in JAK1 (c.2099G>A; p.S700N), the unaffected carrier T cells predominantly expressed the wild-type JAK1 allele, whereas the affected carrier T cells exhibited biallelic expression. Allelic expression bias was also documented in phenotypically discordant family members with mutations in STAT1 and CARD11. This study highlights the importance of considering both the genotype and the 'transcriptotype' in analyses of the penetrance and expressivity of monogenic disorders.

abstract: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is highly polymorphic, and host mtDNA variation has been associated with altered cancer severity. To determine the basis of this mtDNA-cancer association, we analyzed conplastic mice with the C57BL/6J (B6) nucleus but two naturally occurring mtDNA lineages, mtDNAB6 and mtDNANZB, where mtDNANZB mitochondria generate more oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-derived reactive oxygen species (mROS). In a cardiac transplant model, mtDNAB6 Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells supported long-term allograft survival, whereas mtDNANZB Treg cells failed to suppress host T effector (Teff) cells, leading to acute rejection. When challenged with melanoma or colon cancer cells, the mtDNANZB mice exhibited strikingly impaired tumor growth while mtDNAB6 mice showed Treg-dependent inhibition of Teff cells and allowed rapid tumor growth. Transcriptional analysis showed that activation of mtDNANZB Teff cells increased mitochondrial gene expression while activation of mtDNANZB Treg cells impaired mitochondrial gene expression and resulted in mtDNANZB Treg cell exhaustion. Induction of the mitochondrially targeted catalytic antioxidant, mCAT, in hematopoietic cells normalized mtDNANZB Treg function in both transplant and tumor models, indicating a key role for mROS in promoting Treg dysfunction. Anti-PD-L1 therapy did not modulate these effects, indicating that modulation of host mitochondrial function provides an independent approach for enhancing tumor cell destruction.

abstract: Acute kidney injury (AKI) can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and subsequently to renal fibrosis. Poor repair of renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) after injury is the main cause of renal fibrosis. Studies have shown that restoring damaged fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) can reduce renal fibrosis. Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is a key enzyme that regulates lipid hydrolysis. This study, for the first time, demonstrated that ATGL was downregulated in the renal TEC in the AKI-CKD transition mouse model. Moveover, treatment with the ATGL inhibitor atglistatin exacerbated lipid accumulation, downregulated FAO level and mitochondrial function while increased the level of oxidative stress injury and apoptosis, resulting in aggravated renal fibrosis. In contrast, ATGL overexpression suppressed lipid accumulation, improved the FAO level and mitochondrial function, attenuated oxidative stress and apoptosis, thereby ameliorated fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. In summary, ATGL regulates renal fibrosis by reprogramming lipid metabolism in renal TECs. This study provided new avenues and targets for treating CKD.

abstract: Prime Editing can rewrite genes in living cells by allowing point mutations, deletions, or insertion of small DNA sequences with high precision. However, its safe and efficient delivery into human stem cells remains a technical challenge. In this report, we engineer Nanoscribes, virus-like particles that encapsidate ribonucleoprotein complexes of the Prime Editing system and allow their delivery into recipient cells. We identify key features that unlock the potential of Nanoscribes, including the use of multiple fusogens, the improvement of pegRNAs structures, their encoding by a Pol II system and the optimization of Prime-Editors. Nanoscribes edit HEK293T with an efficiency of 68% at the HEK3 locus with increased fidelity over DNA-transfection and support pegRNA-multiplexing. Importantly, Nanoscribes permit editing of myoblasts, hiPSCs and hiPSCs-derived hematopoietic stem cells with an editing efficiency up to 25%. Nanoscribes is an asset for development of next generation genome editing approaches using VLPs.

abstract: Neurotensin (NTS) is a secretory peptide produced by lymphatic endothelial cells. Our previous study revealed that NTS suppressed the activity of brown adipose tissue via interactions with NTSR2. In the current study, we found that the depletion of Ntsr2 in white adipocytes upregulated food intake, while the local treatment of NTS suppressed food intake. Our mechanistic study revealed that suppression of NTS-NTSR2 signaling enhanced the phosphorylation of ceramide synthetase 2, increased the abundance of its products ceramides C20-C24, and downregulated the production of GDF15 in white adipose tissues, which was responsible for the elevation of food intake. We discovered a potential causal and positive correlation between serum C20-C24 ceramide levels and human food intake in four populations with different ages and ethnic backgrounds. Together, our study shows that NTS-NTSR2 signaling in white adipocytes can regulate food intake via its direct control of lipid metabolism and production of GDF15. The ceramides C20-C24 are key factors regulating food intake in mammals.

abstract: Following myocardial infarction (MI), the accumulation of CD86-positive macrophages in the ischemic injury zone leads to secondary myocardial damage. Precise pharmacological intervention targeting this process remains challenging. This study engineered a nanotherapeutic delivery system with CD86-positive macrophage-specific targeting and ultrasound-responsive release capabilities. A folic acid (FA)-modified ultrasound-responsive gene/drug delivery system, assembled from DOTAP, DSPE-PEG2000-FA, cholesterol, and perfluorohexane (PFH)-termed FA-PNBs-was developed to codeliver small interfering RNA of STAT1 (siSTAT1) and the small-molecule nitro-oleic acid (OA-NO2) into CD86-positive macrophages. Upon irradiation with low-intensity focused ultrasound, FA-PNBs release siSTAT1 and OA-NO2 at the ischemic injury zone. The results demonstrated the system's precise targeting and efficient delivery capabilities. The combined modulation of OA-NO2 and siSTAT1 optimizes the immune microenvironment in the infarcted region, alleviates ventricular remodeling, preserves cardiac function, and holds promise for clinical intervention strategies after MI.

abstract: Exercise can rapidly increase core body temperature, and research has indicated that elevated internal body temperature can independently contribute to fatigue during physical activity. However, the precise mechanisms responsible for regulating thermogenesis in muscles during exercise have remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that cellular Feimin (cFeimin) enhances exercise performance by inhibiting muscle thermogenesis during physical activity. Mechanistically, we found that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates cFeimin and facilitates its translocation into the cell nucleus during exercise. Within the nucleus, cFeimin binds to the forkhead transcription factor FOXC2, leading to the suppressed expression of sarcolipin (Sln), which is a key regulator of muscle thermogenesis. In addition, our results further reveal that short-term AMPK agonist treatments can enhance exercise performance through the activation of the AMPK-cFeimin signalling pathway. In summary, these results underscore the crucial role of cFeimin in enhancing exercise performance by modulating SLN-mediated thermogenesis.

abstract: Tertiary lymphoid structures play important roles in autoimmune and non-autoimmune conditions. While many of the molecular mechanisms involved in tertiary lymphoid structure formation have been identified, the cellular sources and temporal and spatial relationship remain unknown. Here we use combine single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and proteomics of minor salivary glands of patients with Sjogren's disease and Sicca Syndrome, with ex-vivo functional studies to construct a cellular and spatial map of key components involved in the formation and function of tertiary lymphoid structures. We confirm the presence of a fibroblast cell state and identify a pericyte/mural cell state with potential immunological functions. The identification of cellular properties associated with these structures and the molecular and functional interactions identified by this analysis may provide key therapeutic cues for tertiary lymphoid structures associated conditions in autoimmunity and cancer.

pmid: 39748116
authors: Roerden M, Spranger S.
source: Nature reviews. Immunology
publication_date: 2025 Jan 2.
abstract: Cancers can avoid immune-mediated elimination by acquiring traits that disrupt antitumour immunity. These mechanisms of immune evasion are selected and reinforced during tumour evolution under immune pressure. Some immunogenic subclones are effectively eliminated by antitumour T cell responses (a process known as immunoediting), which results in a clonally selected tumour. Other cancer cells arise to resist immunoediting, which leads to a tumour that includes several distinct cancer cell populations (referred to as intratumour heterogeneity (ITH)). Tumours with high ITH are associated with poor patient outcomes and a lack of responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. In this Review, we discuss the different ways that cancer cells evade the immune system and how these mechanisms impact immunoediting and tumour evolution. We also describe how subclonal antigen presentation in tumours with high ITH can result in immune evasion.

abstract: Background:
Early neurological deterioration (END) is associated with a poor prognosis in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Effectively lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) can improve the stability of atherosclerotic plaque and reduce post-stroke inflammation, which may be an effective means to lower the incidence of END. The objective of this study was to determine the preventive effects of evolocumab on END in patients with non-cardiogenic AIS.

abstract: We performed a systems vaccinology analysis to investigate immune responses in humans to an H5N1 influenza vaccine, with and without the AS03 adjuvant, to identify factors influencing antibody response magnitude and durability. Our findings revealed a platelet and adhesion-related blood transcriptional signature on day 7 that predicted the longevity of the antibody response, suggesting a potential role for platelets in modulating antibody response durability. As platelets originate from megakaryocytes, we explored the effect of thrombopoietin (TPO)-mediated megakaryocyte activation on antibody response longevity. We found that TPO administration enhanced the durability of vaccine-induced antibody responses. TPO-activated megakaryocytes also promoted survival of human bone-marrow plasma cells through integrin β1/β2-mediated cell-cell interactions, along with survival factors APRIL and the MIF-CD74 axis. Using machine learning, we developed a classifier based on this platelet-associated signature, which predicted antibody response longevity across six vaccines from seven independent trials, highlighting a conserved mechanism for vaccine durability.

abstract: Malaria vaccines consisting of metabolically active Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites can offer improved protection compared with currently deployed subunit vaccines. In a previous study, we demonstrated the superior protective efficacy of a three-dose regimen of late-arresting genetically attenuated parasites administered by mosquito bite (GA2-MB) compared with early-arresting counterparts (GA1-MB) against a homologous controlled human malaria infection. Encouraged by these results, we explored the potency of a single GA2-MB immunization in a placebo-controlled randomized trial. Primary outcomes were safety and tolerability, time-to-parasitemia and protective efficacy. Humoral and cellular immunological results were considered secondary outcomes. Here we report the safe administration of GA2-MB with no breakthrough malaria and sterile protection in nine of ten participants at 6 weeks after a single immunization with 50 GA2-infected mosquitoes, compared with none of five mock-immunized participants, against a homologous controlled human malaria infection. Immunization increased circulating Pf-specific polyfunctional effector memory CD4+ T cells coexpressing tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-2. This unprecedented 90% protective efficacy after a single low-dose immunization holds great promise for the potency of GA2 immunization. Future studies should demonstrate whether GA2 is similarly efficacious in pre-exposed populations and whether the favorable safety profile reported here holds up in larger groups.

abstract: Genome-wide association studies have identified approximately 200 genetic risk loci for breast cancer, but the causal variants and target genes are mostly unknown. We sought to fine-map all known breast cancer risk loci using genome-wide association study data from 172,737 female breast cancer cases and 242,009 controls of African, Asian and European ancestry. We identified 332 independent association signals for breast cancer risk, including 131 signals not reported previously, and for 50 of them, we narrowed the credible causal variants down to a single variant. Analyses integrating functional genomics data identified 195 putative susceptibility genes, enriched in PI3K/AKT, TNF/NF-κB, p53 and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. Single-cell RNA sequencing or in vitro experiment data provided additional functional evidence for 105 genes. Our study uncovered large numbers of association signals and candidate susceptibility genes for breast cancer, uncovered breast cancer genetics and biology, and supported the value of including multi-ancestry data in fine-mapping analyses.

abstract: Tirzepatide is a dual agonist of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors and is a promising therapeutic option for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Nevertheless, its effect and underlying mechanism on hepatic steatosis remain ambiguous. Herein, we explored the impact of tirzepatide on improving hepatic steatosis in diabetic mice, with a particular focus on the gut microbiota and bile acids (BAs) using animal models. The tirzepatide effectively reduced body weight, improved insulin resistance, decreased serum and hepatic lipid levels, and mitigated liver injury. Compared to semaglutide, tirzepatide exhibited superior efficacy in reducing hepatic lipid accumulation. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and targeted metabolomics of BAs revealed that tirzepatide ameliorated gut microbiota dysbiosis and BAs metabolism in diabetic mice. Notably, tirzepatide observably increased the abundance of beneficial genera such as Akkermansia, elevated the ratio of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonists (glycoursodeoxycholic acid: GUDCA, β-muricholic acid: β-MCA, hyodeoxycholic acid: HDCA, ursodeoxycholic acid: UDCA) to natural agonists (cholic acid: CA, lithocholic acid: LCA, chenodeoxycholic acid: CDCA, glycocholic acid: GCA, taurodeoxycholic acid: TDCA), and reduced FXR expression in intestinal tissues. In conclusion, tirzepatide attenuated hepatic steatosis in diabetic mice and regulated the gut microbiota and BAs metabolism, which may help to provide a novel therapeutic approach and therapeutic target for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).

abstract: Autophagosome cancer vaccines can promote cross-presentation of multiple tumour antigens and induce cross-reactive T cell responses. However, so far, there is no effective method for obtaining a highly immunogenic autophagosomal cancer vaccine because autophagosomes, once formed, quickly fuse with lysosomes and cannot easily escape from cells. Here we report a functional Ti2NX nanodot that caps the autophagosome membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate, blocking the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and producing stable nanodot-coated autophagosomes in tumours. The formed nanodot-coated autophagosomes can escape from cancer cells to lymph nodes, where they activate tumour-specific T cells. We show that our approach reduces tumour burden and provide long-term immune surveillance protection for cured mice. This work provides a method for the direct formation of personalized autophagosome-based cancer vaccines in vivo, offering a promising strategy for tumour treatment.

abstract: Recently acquired memories are reactivated in the hippocampus during sleep, an initial step for their consolidation1-3. This process is concomitant with the hippocampal reactivation of previous memories4-6, posing the problem of how to prevent interference between older and recent, initially labile, memory traces. Theoretical work has suggested that consolidating multiple memories while minimizing interference can be achieved by randomly interleaving their reactivation7-10. An alternative is that a temporal microstructure of sleep can promote the reactivation of different types of memories during specific substates. Here, to test these two hypotheses, we developed a method to simultaneously record large hippocampal ensembles and monitor sleep dynamics through pupillometry in naturally sleeping mice. Oscillatory pupil fluctuations revealed a previously unknown microstructure of non-REM sleep-associated memory processes. We found that memory replay of recent experiences dominated in sharp-wave ripples during contracted pupil substates of non-REM sleep, whereas replay of previous memories preferentially occurred during dilated pupil substates. Selective closed-loop disruption of sharp-wave ripples during contracted pupil non-REM sleep impaired the recall of recent memories, whereas the same manipulation during dilated pupil substates had no behavioural effect. Stronger extrinsic excitatory inputs characterized the contracted pupil substate, whereas higher recruitment of local inhibition was prominent during dilated pupil substates. Thus, the microstructure of non-REM sleep organizes memory replay, with previous versus new memories being temporally segregated in different substates and supported by local and input-driven mechanisms, respectively. Our results suggest that the brain can multiplex distinct cognitive processes during sleep to facilitate continuous learning without interference.

abstract: The switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis is crucial for microglial activation. Recent studies highlight that histone lactylation promotes macrophage homeostatic gene expression via transcriptional regulation, but its role in microglia activation in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that inhibiting glycolysis with 2-deoxy-D-glucose alleviates microgliosis, neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neurons damage by reducing lactate accumulation in PD mice. Notably, we observed a marked increase in histone lactylation, particularly H3K9 lactylation, in microglia in the substantia nigra of PD mice. Mechanistically, CUT&Tag and Chip-qPCR analyses revealed that H3K9 lactylation enriched at the SLC7A11promoter and activated its expression. Importantly, inhibiting SLC7A11 by sulfasalazine mitigated microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and improved motor function in PD mice. Moreover, we found that lactate-induce histone lactylation is dependent on P300/CBP. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that glycolysis-derived lactate promotes microglial activation via histone lactylation and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for PD.

abstract: Doxorubicin, a representative drug of the anthracycline class, is widely used in cancer treatment. However, Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) presents a significant challenge in its clinical application. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in DIC, primarily through disrupting mitochondrial dynamics. This study aimed to investigate the impact of Rnd3 (a Rho family GTPase 3) on DIC, with a focus on mitochondrial dynamics. Cardiomyocyte-specific Rnd3 transgenic mice (Rnd3-Tg) and Rnd3LSP/LSP mice (N-Tg) were established for in vivo experiments, and adenoviruses harboring Rnd3 (Ad-Rnd3) or negative control (Ad-Control) were injected in the myocardium for in vitro experiments. The DIC model was established using wild-type, N-Tg, and Rnd3-Tg mice, with subsequent intraperitoneal injection of Dox for 4 weeks. The molecular mechanism was explored through RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence staining, co-immunoprecipitation assay, and protein-protein docking. Dox administration induced significant mitochondrial injury and cardiac dysfunction, which was ameliorated by Rnd3 overexpression. Further, the augmentation of Rnd3 expression mitigated mitochondrial fragmentation which is mediated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), thereby ameliorating the PANoptosis (pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis) response induced by Dox. Mechanically, the interaction between Rnd3 and Rho-associated kinase 1 (Rock1) may impede Rock1-induced Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser616, thus inhibiting mitochondrial fission and dysfunction. Interestingly, Rock1 knockdown nullified the effects of Rnd3 on cardiomyocytes PANoptosis, as well as Dox-induced cardiac remodeling and dysfunction elicited by Rnd3. Rnd3 enhances cardiac resilience against DIC by stabilizing mitochondrial dynamics and reducing PANoptosis. Our findings suggest that the Rnd3/Rock1/Drp1 signaling pathway represents a novel target for mitigating DIC, and modulating Rnd3 expression could be a strategic approach to safeguarding cardiac function in patients undergoing Dox treatment. The graphical abstract illustrated the cardioprotective role of Rnd3 in DIC. Rnd3 directly binds to Rock1 in cytoplasm and ameliorates mitochondrial fission by inhibiting Drp1 phosphorylation at ser616, thereby alleviating PANoptosis (apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis) in DIC.

abstract: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a common pregnancy disease, has long-term negative effects on offspring health. Epigenetic changes may have important contributions to that, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report the influence of GDM on DNA methylation of offspring (GDF1) oocytes and the possible mechanisms. Our results show that GDM induces genomic hyper-methylation of offspring oocytes, and at least a part of the altered methylation is inherited by F2 oocytes, which may be a reason for the inheritance of metabolic disorders. We further find that GDM exposure increases the expression of Ezh2 in oocytes. Ezh2 regulates DNA methylation via DNMT1, and Ezh2 knockdown reduces the genomic methylation level of GDF1 oocytes. These results suggest that GDM may induce oocyte genomic hyper-methylation of offspring via enhancing the Ezh2 expression recruiting more DNMT1 into nucleus.

abstract: Single-cell transcriptomics applied to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for elucidating the pathophysiology of neurologic diseases has produced only a preliminary characterization of CSF immune cells. CSF derives from and borders central nervous system (CNS) tissue, allowing for comprehensive accounting of cell types along with their relative abundance and immunologic profiles relevant to CNS diseases. Using integration techniques applied to publicly available datasets in combination with our own studies, we generated a compendium with 139 subjects encompassing 135 CSF and 58 blood samples. Healthy subjects and individuals across a wide range of diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, COVID-19, and autoimmune encephalitis, were included. We found differences in lymphocyte and myeloid subset frequencies across different diseases as well as in their distribution between blood and CSF. We identified what we believe to be a new subset of AREG+ dendritic cells exclusive to the CSF that was more abundant in subjects with MS compared with healthy controls. Finally, transcriptional cell states in CSF microglia-like cells and lymphoid subsets were elucidated. Altogether, we have created a reference compendium for single-cell transcriptional profiling encompassing CSF immune cells useful to the scientific community for future studies on neurologic diseases.

abstract: Cervical cancer is preventable with screening and vaccination approaches; however, access to these preventative measures is limited both nationally and globally and thus many women will still develop cervical cancer. Novel treatments and practice-changing research have improved cervical cancer outcomes over the past few decades. In this Review, we discuss clinical trials that have refined or redefined the treatment of cervical cancers across the early stage, locally advanced, persistent, recurrent and/or metastatic disease settings. Advances for patients with early stage disease have been achieved through trials evaluating less extensive and fertility-preserving surgeries, different surgical approaches (open versus minimally invasive), and sentinel versus full pelvic lymph node dissection. We also discuss results from trials testing the use of neoadjuvant, induction and adjuvant chemotherapy as well as immune-checkpoint inhibitors in patients with locally advanced disease. Finally, we review the progress made with systemic chemotherapy and novel therapeutics, including anti-angiogenic agents, immune-checkpoint inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates, in the setting of metastatic and/or recurrent cervical cancer. The advances highlighted in this manuscript have reduced morbidity and improved overall survival for patients with this challenging-to-treat disease, while also inspiring additional research and trials in the field.

abstract: Many cancer cells exhibit increased amounts of paucimannose glycans, which are truncated N-glycan structures rarely found in mammals. Paucimannosidic proteins are proposedly generated within lysosomes and exposed on the cell surface through a yet uncertain mechanism. In this study, we revealed that paucimannosidic proteins are produced by lysosomal glycosidases and secreted via lysosomal exocytosis. Interestingly, lysosomal exocytosis preferentially occurred in the vicinity of focal adhesions, protein complexes connecting the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Through genome-wide knockout screening, we identified that MYO18B, an actin crosslinker, is required for focal adhesion maturation, facilitating lysosomal exocytosis and the release of paucimannosidic lysosomal proteins to the extracellular milieu. Moreover, a mechanosensitive cation channel PIEZO1 locally activated at focal adhesions imports Ca2+ necessary for lysosome-plasma membrane fusion. Collectively, our study unveiled an intimate relationship between lysosomal exocytosis and focal adhesion, shedding light on the unexpected interplay between lysosomal activities and cellular mechanosensing.

abstract: Chondrocyte senescence is an important pathogenic factor causing osteoarthritis (OA) progression through persistently producing pro-inflammatory factors. Mesenchymal stem cells-derived small extracellular vesicles (MSC-sEVs) have shown anti-inflammatory effects in OA models, while persistent existence of senescent chondrocytes still promotes cartilage destruction. Therefore, improving the targeted elimination ability on senescent chondrocytes is required to facilitate the translation of MSC-sEVs in OA treatment. In this study, versatile engineered MSC-sEVs are developed to targetedly clear senescent chondrocytes and maintain cartilage metabolic homeostasis. Specifically, MSC-sEVs are loaded with siRNA mouse double minute 2 homologue (siMDM2) and modified with cartilage-targeting peptide WYRGRL-PEG2K-DSPE (WPD), named WPD-sEVssiMDM2. The results demonstrate versatile modification improves the cellular uptake of MSC-sEVs in chondrocytes, and thus improves the antiaging effects. Importantly, multifunctional modification enhances cartilage penetration ability and extends joint retention time of MSC-sEVs. In both post-traumatic OA mice and naturally aged mice, WPD-sEVssiMDM2 more effectively eliminates senescent chondrocytes and maintained matrix metabolic homeostasis. By using the P53 phosphorylation inhibitor, the essential role MDM2-P53 pathway in the antiaging function of WPD-sEVssiMDM2 on chondrocytes is verified. In ex vivo cultured human OA cartilage explants, it is confirmed that WPD-sEVssiMDM2 alleviates senescent phenotype. Altogether, the findings suggest that WPD-sEVssiMDM2 have promising translational potential for OA treatment.

abstract: Ovarian function declines significantly as females enter middle-age, but the mechanisms underlying this decline remain unclear. Here, we utilize whole-organ imaging to observe a notable decrease in ovarian blood vessel (oBV) density and angiogenesis intensity of middle-aged mice. This leads to a diminished blood supply to the ovaries, resulting in inadequate development and maturation of ovarian follicles. Utilizing genetic-modified mouse models, we demonstrate that granulosa cell secreted VEGFA governs ovarian angiogenesis, but the physiological decline in oBV is not attributed to VEGFA insufficiency. Instead, through single-cell sequencing, we identify the aging of the ovarian vascular endothelium as the primary factor contributing to oBV decline. Consequently, the administration of salidroside, a natural compound that is functional to reverse oBV aging and promote ovarian angiogenesis, significantly enhances ovarian blood supply and improve fertility in older females. Our findings highlight that enhancing oBV function is a promising strategy to boost fertility in females.

abstract: Ca2+ overload and mitochondrial dysfunction play crucial roles in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Piezo1, a mechanosensitive cation channel, is essential for intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. The objective of this research was to explore the effects of Piezo1 on mitochondrial function during myocardial I/R injury. We showed that the expression of myocardial Piezo1 was elevated in the infracted area of I/R and cardiomyocyte-specific Piezo1 deficiency (Piezo1△Myh6) mice attenuated I/R by decreasing infarct size and cardiac dysfunction. Piezo1△Myh6 regulated mitochondrial fusion and fission to improve mitochondrial function and decrease inflammation and oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, myocardial Piezo1 knockout alleviated intracellular calcium overload to normalize calpain-associated mitochondrial homeostasis. Our findings indicated that Piezo1 depletion in cardiomyocytes partially restored mitochondrial homeostasis during cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study suggests an innovative therapeutic strategy to alleviate cardiac I/R injury.

abstract: Adverse aortic remodeling increases the risk of aorta-related adverse events (AAEs) after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and affects the overall prognosis of aortic dissection (AD). It is imperative to delve into the exploration of prognostic indicators to streamline the identification of individuals at elevated risk for postoperative AAEs, and therapeutic targets to optimize the efficacy of TEVAR for patients with AD. Here, we perform proteomic and single-cell transcriptomic analyses of peripheral blood and aortic lesions, respectively, from patients with AD and healthy subjects. The integrated multi-omics profiling identifies that highly phenotype-associated macrophages orchestrate neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) through CXCL3/CXCR2 axis, thereby promoting the development of AD. Increased NETs formation is a defining feature of systemic immunity and aortic microenvironment of AD. Inhibiting NETs formation through the blockade of citrullinated histone H3 or CXCL3/CXCR2 axis ameliorates the progression and rupture of aortic dissection in male mice. The plasma level of citrullinated histone H3 predicts AAEs following endovascular therapy, facilitating the risk stratification and prognostic evaluation for patients with AD.

abstract: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the esophagus. It is diagnosed in the setting of symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and an eosinophilic predominant infiltrate in the esophagus. The condition is rapidly increasing in incidence and prevalence and is commonly encountered in gastroenterology and allergy practices, emergency departments, and primary care settings. Over the past decade, there have been paradigm shifts in disease diagnosis and management, increases in knowledge about EoE risk factors, natural history, and pathogenesis, and development of validated outcome metrics. This updated American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Guideline uses Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology to make recommendations across domains of diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and assessment of response, and pediatric-specific considerations. Proton pump inhibitors, topical steroids, empiric diet elimination, a biologic, and esophageal dilation are all recommended treatments; feeding therapy is used adjunctively in children with food aversion or feeding dysfunction. Monitoring with clinical, endoscopic, and histologic assessments is recommended to assess for treatment response and follow patients over time with maintenance therapy. When evaluating and following patients with EoE, consideration should be given to assessing and controlling both the inflammatory and fibrostenotic aspects of disease.

abstract: Early prediction of acute kidney injury (AKI) may provide a crucial opportunity for AKI prevention. To date, no prediction model targeting AKI among general hospitalized patients in developing countries has been published. Here we show a simple, real-time, interpretable AKI prediction model for general hospitalized patients developed from a large tertiary hospital in China, which has been validated across five independent, geographically distinct, different tiered hospitals. The model containing 20 readily available variables demonstrates consistent, high levels of predictive discrimination in validation cohort, with AUCs for serum creatinine-based AKI and severe AKI within 48 h ranging from 0.74-0.85 and 0.83-0.90 for transported models and from 0.81-0.90 and 0.88-0.95 for refitted models, respectively. With optimal probability cutoffs, the refitted model could predict AKI at a median of 72 (24-198) hours in advance in internal validation, and 54-90 h in advance in external validation. Broad application of the model in the future may provide an effective, convenient and cost-effective approach for AKI prevention.

abstract: Histone deacetylase HDAC6 has been implicated in regulating antiviral innate immunity. However, its precise function in response to DNA virus infection remains elusive. Herein, we find that HDAC6 deficiency promotes the activation of cGAS-STING signaling and type I interferon (IFN) production, both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in a decrease in HSV-1 infection. Mechanistically, HDAC6 deacetylates tripartite motif protein 56 (TRIM56) at K110 in mice, thereby impairing the monoubiquitination cGAS and its DNA binding ability. Overexpression of TRIM56 K110Q protects mice against HSV-1 infection. Notably, different amino acids at position 110 of TRIM56 in human and mouse cause species-specific IFN responses. Further, we show that during early stages of HSV-1 infection, the viral protein US3 phosphorylates HDAC6 to inhibit the cGAS-mediated antiviral response. Our results suggest that HDAC6 inhibits cGAS activation through TRIM56 deacetylation in a species-specific manner.

abstract: Prolonged exposure to interferon-gamma (IFNγ) and the associated increased expression of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) create an intracellular shortage of tryptophan in the cancer cells, which stimulates ribosomal frameshifting and tryptophan to phenylalanine (W>F) codon reassignments during protein synthesis. Here, we investigated whether such neoepitopes can be useful targets of adoptive T cell therapy. Immunopeptidomic analyses uncovered hundreds of W>F neoepitopes mainly presented by the HLA-A∗24:02 allele. We identified a T cell receptor (TCRTMBIM6W>F.1) possessing high affinity and specificity toward TMBIM6W>F/HLA-A∗24:02, the inducible W>F neoepitope with the broadest expression across cancer cell lines. TCRTMBIM6W>F.1 T cells are activated by tryptophan-depleted cancer cells but not by non-cancer cells. Finally, we provide in vivo proof of concept for clinical application, whereby TCRMART1 T cells promote cancer cell killing by TCRTMBIM6W>F.1 T cells through the generation of W>F neoepitopes. Thus, neoepitopes arising from W>F substitution present shared and highly expressed immunogenic targets with the potential to overcome current limitations in adoptive T cell therapy.

abstract: The balance between CD8+ T cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapy in gastric carcinoma (GC). However, related factors leading to the disturbance of TME and resistance to ICI therapy remain unknown. In this study, we applied N6-methyladenosine (m6A) small RNA Epitranscriptomic Microarray and screened out 3'tRF-AlaAGC based on its highest differential expression level and lowest inter-group variance. N6-methyladenosine modification significantly enhanced the stability of 3'tRF-AlaAGC, which strengthened glycolysis and lactic acid (LA) production in GC cells by binding to PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1). In the peritoneal GC implantation model established in huPBMC-NCG mice, 3'tRF-AlaAGC significantly increased the proportion of PD1+ Treg cells. Furthermore, in high-LA environments driven by glucose consumption of GC cells, Treg cells actively uptake LA through MCT1, facilitating NFAT1 translocation into the nucleus and enhancing PD1 expression, whereas PD1 expression by effector T cell is diminished. Meanwhile, T cell suppression assays were performed under low-LA or high-LA conditions, and the proliferation of CD8+ T cells was dampened by adding Sintilimab in a high-LA but not in a low-LA environment, suggesting the preferential activation of PD1+ Treg cell. These findings deciphered the complexities of the immune microenvironment in GC, providing prospects for identifying robust biomarkers that could improve the evaluation of therapeutic effectiveness and prognosis in immune therapy for GC.

abstract: Therapy-exposed surviving cancer cells may have encountered profound epigenetic remodeling that renders these drug-tolerant persisters candidate drivers of particularly aggressive relapses. Typically presenting as slow-to-nongrowing cells, persisters are senescent or senescence-like cells. In this issue of Cancer Research, Ramponi and colleagues study mTOR/PI3K inhibitor-induced embryonic diapause-like arrest (DLA) as a model of persistence in lung cancer and melanoma cells and compare this persister condition with therapy-induced senescence in the same cells. The DLA phenotype recapitulated some but not all features attributed to senescent cells, lacking, for instance, an inflammatory secretome otherwise known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. A CRISPR dropout screen pointed to methyl group-providing one-carbon metabolism and further to H4K20me3-mediated repression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype-related IFN response genes selectively in DLA-like persister cells. Conversely, inhibition of H4K20-active KMT5B/C methyltransferases derepressed inflammatory programs and was toxic in DLA cells. These findings not only suggest exploitable vulnerabilities of DLA-like persister cells but also unveil general technical and conceptual challenges of cultured multipassage cell line-based persister studies. Collectively, the approach chosen and insights obtained will stimulate a productive scientific debate on senescence-like features and their reversibility across drug-tolerant persister cells.

abstract: The role of the immune system in regulating tissue stem cells remains poorly understood, as does the relationship between immune-mediated tissue damage and regeneration. Graft vs. host disease (GVHD) occurring after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) involves immune-mediated damage to the intestinal epithelium and its stem cell compartment. To assess impacts of T-cell-driven injury on distinct epithelial constituents, we have performed single cell RNA sequencing on intestinal crypts following experimental BMT. Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) from GVHD mice have exhibited global transcriptomic changes associated with a substantial Interferon-γ response and upregulation of STAT1. To determine its role in crypt function, STAT1 has been deleted within murine intestinal epithelium. Following allo-BMT, STAT1 deficiency has resulted in reduced epithelial proliferation and impaired ISC recovery. Similarly, epithelial Interferon-γ receptor deletion has also attenuated proliferation and ISC recovery post-transplant. Investigating the mechanistic basis underlying this epithelial response, ISC STAT1 expression in GVHD has been found to correlate with upregulation of ISC c-Myc. Furthermore, activated T cells have stimulated Interferon-γ-dependent epithelial regeneration in co-cultured organoids, and Interferon-γ has directly induced STAT1-dependent c-Myc expression and ISC proliferation. These findings illustrate immunologic regulation of a core tissue stem cell program after damage and support a role for Interferon-γ as a direct contributor to epithelial regeneration.

abstract: In recent years, it has been increasingly recognized that tumor growth relies not only on support from the surrounding microenvironment but also on the tumors capacity to adapt to - and actively manipulate - its niche. While targeting angiogenesis and modulating the local immune environment have been explored as therapeutic approaches, these strategies have yet to yield effective treatments for brain tumors and remain under refinement. More recently, the nervous system itself has been explored as a critical environmental support for cancer, with extensive neuro-tumoral interactions observed both intracranially and in extracranial sites containing neural components. In the brain, interactions between glioma cells as well as metastatic lesions with neural components have clinical implications for diagnostics, risk assessments, neurological sequelae, and the development of innovative therapeutics. Here, we review these neuro-tumoral dynamics, emphasizing aspects relevant to neurosurgical practice.

abstract: β-secretase (BACE1) is instrumental in amyloid-β (Aβ) production, with overexpression noted in Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. The interaction of Aβ with the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) facilitates cerebral uptake of Aβ and exacerbates its neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation, further augmenting BACE1 expression. Given the limitations of previous BACE1 inhibition efforts, the study explores reducing BACE1 expression to mitigate AD pathology. The research reveals that the anticancer agent 6-thioguanosine (6-TG) markedly diminishes BACE1 expression without eliciting cytotoxicity while enhancing microglial phagocytic activity, and ameliorate cognitive impairments with reducing Aβ accumulation in AD mice. Leveraging advanced deep learning-based tool for target identification, and corroborating with surface plasmon resonance assays, it is elucidated that 6-TG directly interacts with RAGE, modulating BACE1 expression through the JAK2-STAT1 pathway and elevating soluble RAGE (sRAGE) levels in the brain. The findings illuminate the therapeutic potential of 6-TG in ameliorating AD manifestations and advocate for small molecule strategies to increase brain sRAGE levels, offering a strategic alternative to the challenges posed by the complexity of AD.

We leveraged summary-level data of genome-wide association studies (PTSD: N = 1,222,882; atrial fibrillation (AF): N = 482,409; coronary artery disease (CAD): N = 1,165,690; hypertension (HT): N = 458,554; heart failure (HF): N = 977,323). First, we estimated genetic correlations and utilized genomic structural equation modeling to identify a common genetic factor for PTSD and CVD. Next, we assessed biological, behavioural, and psychosocial factors as potential mediators. Finally, we employed multivariable Mendelian randomization to examine causal pathways between PTSD and CVD, incorporating the same potential mediators. Significant genetic correlations were found between PTSD and CAD, HT, and HF (rg = 0.21-0.32, p ≤ 3.08 · 10-16), but not between PTSD and AF. Insomnia, smoking, alcohol dependence, waist-to-hip ratio, and inflammation (IL6, C-reactive protein) partly mediated these associations. Mendelian randomization indicated that PTSD causally increases CAD (IVW OR = 1.53, 95% CIs = 1.19-1.96, p = 0.001), HF (OR = 1.44, CIs = 1.08-1.92, p = 0.012), and to a lesser degree HT (OR = 1.25, CIs = 1.05-1.49, p = 0.012). While insomnia, smoking, alcohol, and inflammation were important mediators, independent causal effects also remained. In addition to shared genetic liability between PTSD and CVD, we present strong evidence for causal effects of PTSD on CVD. Crucially, we implicate specific lifestyle and biological mediators (insomnia, substance use, inflammation) which has important implications for interventions to prevent CVD in PTSD patients.

abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has revolutionized the treatment of various hematological malignancies. Recently, CAR-T has been used in refractory auto-immune diseases with initial encouraging results. In this systematic review, we examined the safety and efficacy of CAR-T in patients with refractory auto-immune diseases. PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus search revealed 1552 articles, of which 24 were included for the final analysis. 80 patients with autoimmune diseases received CAR-T cell therapy, of which 52 patients had systemic lupus erythematosus, 16 patients had systemic sclerosis, 7 patients had idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, 2 patient had anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome, 2 patients had rheumatoid arthritis, and 1 patient had Sjogren's disease. 44 patients got CD-19 CAR-T and 36 patients got BCMA/CD-19 compound CAR-T. All the patients achieved an immunosuppression-free state at the last follow-up. Of the 47 patients with follow-up data, 79 patients developed cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and 4 patients developed neurotoxicity. None of the patients had fatal adverse events with CAR-T cell therapy. CAR-T appears to be safe and effective in patients with refractory autoimmune diseases. Future studies are crucial to further validate these findings, explore long-term outcomes, and refine the treatment protocols to enhance efficacy and safety.

abstract: Understanding the molecular landscape of nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is essential to improve risk assessment and treatment regimens. We performed a comprehensive genomic analysis of patients with NMIBC using whole-exome sequencing (n = 438), shallow whole-genome sequencing (n = 362) and total RNA sequencing (n = 414). A large genomic variation within NMIBC was observed and correlated with different molecular subtypes. Frequent loss of heterozygosity in FGFR3 and 17p (affecting TP53) was found in tumors with mutations in FGFR3 and TP53, respectively. Whole-genome doubling (WGD) was observed in 15% of the tumors and was associated with worse outcomes. Tumors with WGD were genomically unstable, with alterations in cell-cycle-related genes and an altered immune composition. Finally, integrative clustering of multi-omics data highlighted the important role of genomic instability and immune cell exhaustion in disease aggressiveness. These findings advance our understanding of genomic differences associated with disease aggressiveness in NMIBC and may ultimately improve patient stratification.

abstract: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) significantly influence tumor progression and therapeutic resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the distributions and functions of CAF subpopulations vary across the four consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) of CRC. This study performed single-cell RNA and bulk RNA sequencing and revealed that myofibroblast-like CAFs (myCAFs), tumor-like CAFs (tCAFs), inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs), CXCL14+CAFs, and MT+CAFs are notably enriched in CMS4 compared with other CMSs of CRC. Multiplex immunohistochemistry was used to validate the distribution of CAF subtypes in patients with different CMSs. Prognosis-related CAF subtypes were identified, leading to the selection of four key genes (COL3A1, COL1A2, GEM, and TMEM47). Through machine learning, we developed a CAF poor-prognosis gene (CAFPRG) model to predict outcomes of patients with CMS4. High levels of CAFPRGs were identified as independent poor-risk factors for prognosis (p < 0.001). Tumors with elevated CAFPRGs exhibited increased infiltration of immune-suppressive cells and resistance to chemotherapy. The expression of these key genes was confirmed to be significantly higher in CAFs than in normal fibroblasts (NFs). Therefore, CAFPRGs may be valuable for precisely predicting patient survival and may present potential therapeutic opportunities for CMS4 CRC.

abstract: With the rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity, several previously under-recognised complications associated with T2DM are becoming more evident. The most common of these emerging complications are metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), cancer, dementia, sarcopenia, and frailty, as well as other conditions involving the lung, heart, and intestinal tract. Likely causative factors are chronic inflammation and insulin resistance, whereas blood glucose levels appear to play a lesser role. We discuss these complications and the new approaches being developed to prevent and manage them, especially incretin-based therapies. We argue that these new interventions may work in a complementary way to other proven cardiorenal protective therapies to reduce the burden of T2DM complications.

abstract: Air pollution is strongly associated with autoimmune diseases (ADs), however, the genetic causality between them remains poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the relationship between common air pollutants and ADs through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. We conducted a MR study using aggregated data from publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 5 common air pollutants are used as instrumental variables. Random-effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) is used as the primary method to assess causal relationships, with results reported in terms of odds ratios (OR). In addition, we used a two-step MR to assess the mediating role of common risk factors for ADs in the effects of air pollution on ADs. Our analysis revealed causal associations between selected air pollutants and specific ADs. Exposure to nitrogen oxides was positively associated with the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (OR = 1.47,95% CI 1.01-2.14, P = 0.043), Sjogren's syndrome (SS) (OR = 2.29,95% CI 1.08-4.89, P = 0.032), and systemic lupus erythematosus (OR = 7.26,95% CI 2.25-23.40, P = 9.10E-04). Genetically predicted PM2.5 and PM10 were risk factors for ulcerative colitis (OR = 1.68,95% CI 1.05-2.68, P = 0.032) and psoriasis (OR = 1.34,95% CI 1.02-1.76, P = 0.037), respectively. Our results also suggest a negative causal relationship between PM2.5-10 and SS (OR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.10-0.90, P = 0.032). In risk factor-related mediation analyses, BMI and smoking mediated 6% (95% CI 1-10%) and 9% (95% CI 2-17%) of the effect of nitrogen oxides on RA, respectively. This study provides evidence of a causal relationship between air pollutants and specific ADs risks, suggesting that improving air pollution may be important in preventing ADs.

publication_date: 2025 Jan 2:S0007-0912(24)00695-0.
abstract: Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist that was first discovered in 1962, has become established in anaesthesia providing dose-dependent anaesthetic, sedative, and analgesic effects. Ketamine, however, also acts on a wide range of other cellular targets, resulting in interesting and diverse effects on both physiological and pathological processes. Potential beneficial properties of ketamine include cardiovascular stability for patients undergoing sedation or anaesthesia, analgesia in both acute and chronic pain, bronchodilation in severe refractory asthma, anti-inflammatory properties particularly in sepsis, tumour inhibition, and antidepressant properties with marked ability to reverse suicidal ideation. The reluctance to adopt ketamine into routine practice is likely attributable in part to the stigma and negative reputation associated with its perceived side-effects and potential for abuse. This review explores the diverse properties and therapeutic potentials of ketamine being investigated across different fields whilst also identifying areas for ongoing and future research. Given the diverse range of potential benefits and promising early work, ketamine should be the focus of ongoing research in multiple different specialty areas. This includes areas relevant to anaesthesia and perioperative medicine, such as acute and chronic pain management, ICU sedation, and even tumour suppression in those undergoing surgical resection of malignancies.

abstract: Fluid shear stress (FSS) from blood flow sensed by vascular endothelial cells (ECs) determines vessel behavior, but regulatory mechanisms are only partially understood. We used cell state transition assessment and regulation (cSTAR), a powerful computational method, to elucidate EC transcriptomic states under low shear stress (LSS), physiological shear stress (PSS), high shear stress (HSS), and oscillatory shear stress (OSS) that induce vessel inward remodeling, stabilization, outward remodeling, or disease susceptibility, respectively. Combined with a publicly available database on EC transcriptomic responses to drug treatments, this approach inferred a regulatory network controlling EC states and made several notable predictions. Particularly, inhibiting cell cycle-dependent kinase (CDK) 2 was predicted to initiate inward remodeling and promote atherogenesis. In vitro, PSS activated CDK2 and induced late G1 cell cycle arrest. In mice, EC deletion of CDK2 triggered inward artery remodeling, pulmonary and systemic hypertension, and accelerated atherosclerosis. These results validate use of cSTAR and identify key determinants of normal and pathological artery remodeling.

abstract: The clinical management of people with multidrug-resistant (MDR) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains challenging despite continued development of antiretroviral agents. A 58-year-old male individual with MDR HIV and Kaposi sarcoma (KS) was treated with a new antiretroviral regimen consisting of anti-CD4 domain 1 antibody UB-421 and capsid inhibitor lenacapavir. The individual experienced delayed but sustained suppression of plasma viremia and a substantial increase in the CD4+ T cell count. A longitudinal examination of plasma HIV and infectious isolates showed no evidence of viral evolution or the emergence of UB-421- or lenacapavir-resistant viruses. The individual received three cycles of liposomal doxorubicin and five doses of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab that resulted in improvement in KS with flattening of lesions. Our data demonstrate that combination therapy with UB-421 could provide sustained virologic suppression in people harboring MDR HIV with limited therapeutic alternatives.

abstract: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors are commonly used to treat non-small cell lung cancers with EGFR mutations, but drug resistance often emerges. Intratumor heterogeneity is a known cause of targeted therapy resistance and is considered a major factor in treatment failure. This study identifies clones of EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung tumors expressing low levels of both wild-type and mutant EGFR protein. These EGFR-low cells are intrinsically more tolerant to EGFR inhibitors, more invasive, and exhibit an epithelial-to-mesenchymal-like phenotype compared to their EGFR-high counterparts. The EGFR-low cells secrete Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) family cytokines, leading to increased recruitment of cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune suppression, thus contributing to the drug-tolerant tumor microenvironment. Notably, pharmacological induction of EGFR using epigenetic inhibitors sensitizes the resistant cells to EGFR inhibition. These findings suggest that intrinsic drug resistance can be prevented or reversed using combination therapies.

abstract: Humans have, throughout history, faced periods of starvation necessitating increased physical effort to gather food. To explore adaptations in muscle function, 13 participants (7 males and 6 females) fasted for seven days. They lost 4.6 ± 0.3 kg lean and 1.4 ± 0.1 kg fat mass. Maximal isometric and isokinetic strength remained unchanged, while peak oxygen uptake decreased by 13%. Muscle glycogen was halved, while expression of electron transport chain proteins was unchanged. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) expression increased 13-fold, accompanied by inhibitory pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphorylation, reduced carbohydrate oxidation and decreased exercise endurance capacity. Fasting had no impact on 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, challenging its proposed role in muscle protein degradation. The participants maintained muscle strength and oxidative enzymes in skeletal muscle during fasting but carbohydrate oxidation and high-intensity endurance capacity were reduced.

      Due to the lack of effective treatment options, the prognosis of patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) remains poor. Although chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy has shown promising effects in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoma, its application in R/R AML is limited by "off-target" effects, which lead to severe bone marrow suppression and limit its clinical application. CAR-natural killer (NK) cells not only exhibit antitumor effects but also demonstrate increased safety and universality. We have developed a new CAR construct that targets CD33 and modified NK cells, specifically eliminating AML cells while reducing severe side effects on stem cells.

abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into clinical diagnostics has the potential to transform doctor-patient interactions. However, the readiness of these models for real-world clinical application remains inadequately tested. This paper introduces the Conversational Reasoning Assessment Framework for Testing in Medicine (CRAFT-MD) approach for evaluating clinical LLMs. Unlike traditional methods that rely on structured medical examinations, CRAFT-MD focuses on natural dialogues, using simulated artificial intelligence agents to interact with LLMs in a controlled environment. We applied CRAFT-MD to assess the diagnostic capabilities of GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mistral and LLaMA-2-7b across 12 medical specialties. Our experiments revealed critical insights into the limitations of current LLMs in terms of clinical conversational reasoning, history-taking and diagnostic accuracy. These limitations also persisted when analyzing multimodal conversational and visual assessment capabilities of GPT-4V. We propose a comprehensive set of recommendations for future evaluations of clinical LLMs based on our empirical findings. These recommendations emphasize realistic doctor-patient conversations, comprehensive history-taking, open-ended questioning and using a combination of automated and expert evaluations. The introduction of CRAFT-MD marks an advancement in testing of clinical LLMs, aiming to ensure that these models augment medical practice effectively and ethically.

abstract: Four genes-DAND5, PKD1L1, MMP21, and CIROP-form a genetic module that has specifically evolved in vertebrate species that harbor motile cilia in their left-right organizer (LRO). We find here that CIROZ (previously known as C1orf127) is also specifically expressed in the LRO of mice, frogs, and fish, where it encodes a protein with a signal peptide followed by 3 zona pellucida N domains, consistent with extracellular localization. We report 16 individuals from 10 families with bi-allelic CIROZ inactivation variants, which cause heterotaxy with congenital heart defects. While the knockout of Ciroz in mice also leads to situs anomalies, we unexpectedly find that its targeted inactivation in zebrafish and Xenopus does not lead to observable LR anomalies. Moreover, CIROZ is absent or obsolete in select animals with motile cilia at their LRO, including Carnivora, Atherinomorpha fish, or jawless vertebrates. In summary, this evo-devo study identifies CIROZ as an essential gene for breaking bilateral embryonic symmetry in humans and mice, whereas we witness its contemporary pseudogenization in discrete vertebrate species.

abstract: The intestinal microbiota is a key environmental factor in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we report that, in the context of mild colonic inflammation, the microbiota protects against colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. This protection is achieved by microbial suppression of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Snhg9. Snhg9 promotes tumor growth through inhibition of the tumor suppressor p53. Snhg9 suppresses p53 activity by dissociating the p53 deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) from the cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 2 (CCAR2). Consequently, the depletion of the microbiota by antibiotics causes upregulation of Snhg9 and accelerates CRC progression. Moreover, Snhg9 is functionally conserved. Human SNHG9 promotes tumor growth via the same mechanism as mouse Snhg9, despite their low sequence similarity.

Our scRNA-seq comparison of 85,107 pre- and 46,111 post-menopausal fallopian tube cells reveals substantial shifts in cell type frequencies, gene expression, transcription factor activity, and cell-to-cell communications during menopause and menstrual cycle. Menstrual cycle dependent hormonal changes regulate distinct molecular states in fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells. Postmenopausal fallopian tubes show high chromatin accessibility in transcription factors associated with aging such as Jun, Fos, and BACH1/2, while hormone receptors were generally downregulated, a small proportion of secretory epithelial cells had high expression of ESR2, IGF1R, and LEPR. While a pre-menopausal secretory epithelial gene cluster is enriched in the immunoreactive molecular subtype, a subset of genes expressed in post-menopausal secretory epithelial cells show enrichment in the mesenchymal molecular type of high-grade serous ovarian cancer.

abstract: Cancer immunotherapy, specifically Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, represents a significant breakthrough in treating cancers. Despite its success in hematological cancers, CAR-T exhibits limited efficacy in solid tumors, which account for more than 90% of all cancers. Solid tumors commonly present unique challenges, including antigen heterogeneity and complex tumor microenvironment (TME). To address these, efforts are being made through improvements in CAR design and the development of advanced validation platforms. While efficacy is limited, some solid tumor types, such as neuroblastoma and gastrointestinal cancers, have shown responsiveness to CAR-T therapy in recent clinical trials. In this review, it is first examined both experimental and computational strategies, such as protein engineering coupled with machine learning, developed to enhance T cell specificity. The challenges and methods associated with T cell delivery and in vivo reprogramming in solid tumors is discussed. It is also explored the advancements in engineered organoid systems, which are emerging as high-fidelity in vitro models that closely mimic the complex human TME and serve as a validation platform for CAR discovery. Collectively, these innovative engineering strategies offer the potential to revolutionize the next generation of CAR-T therapy, ultimately paving the way for more effective treatments in solid tumors.

abstract: Although chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are effective against B-lineage malignancies, post-CAR relapse is common, and efficacy in other tumors is limited. These challenges may be addressed through rational manipulations to control CAR T cell function. Here we examine the impact of cognate T cell antigen experience on subsequent CD8+ CAR T cell activity. Prior antigen encounter resulted in superior effector function against leukemia expressing low target antigen density at the expense of reduced proliferative capacity and susceptibility to dysfunction at limiting CAR doses. Distinctive temporal transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles in naive-derived and memory-derived CAR T cells identified RUNX family transcription factors as potential targets to augment the function of naive-derived CD8+ CAR T cells. RUNX2 overexpression enhanced antitumor efficacy of mouse CAR T cells, dependent on prior cell state, and heightened human CAR T cell functions. Our data demonstrate that prior antigen experience of CAR T cells determines functional attributes and amenability to transcription factor-mediated functional enhancement.

abstract: The exchange of molecular information across kingdoms is crucial for the survival of both plants and their pathogens. Recent research has identified that plants transfer their small RNAs and microRNAs into fungal pathogens to suppress infection. However, whether and how plants send defense proteins into pathogens remains unknown. Here, we report that rice (Oryza sativa) plants package defense proteins into extracellular vesicles (EVs) and deliver them to the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani. These EVs, enriched with host defense proteins, are internalized by the fungal cells. Reducing the transfer of host defense proteins via EVs results in increased disease susceptibility. Furthermore, the overexpression of host defense proteins in either rice plants or the fungal cells reduced the infection. Therefore, plants use EVs to send defense proteins into fungal pathogens, thereby combating infection. This mechanism represents a form of protein exchange between plants and pathogens, which contributes to reducing crop diseases.

abstract: Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are specific types of anticonvulsants used to treat epileptic seizures. However, several studies have shown an association between ASMs and an increased risk of hematological disorders, such as thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, and platelet function disorders leading to prolonged bleeding times. This review explores the existing literature on this topic, investigating a wide variety of ASMs, ranging from first-generation medications to newer ones. A comprehensive search was conducted on all the currently approved ASMs using PubMed and Google Scholar: review articles, clinical trials, meta-analysis, observational studies, case reports, and relevant animal studies were identified. We extracted 15 ASMs including valproic acid (VPA), carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, diazepam, clonazepam, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, felbamate, topiramate, pregabalin, lacosamide, cannabidiol (CBD), and perampanel that contain considerable literature regarding different coagulopathies. An in-depth review of over 140 studies revealed a robust association between ASM-induced changes and the onset of bleeding disorders via several different mechanisms. Polytherapy, the use of multiple ASMs, also emerged as a significant risk factor for the development of coagulopathies. This review highlights the potential link between ASMs and bleeding disorders, emphasizing the importance of considering this risk during treatment planning. By understanding these associations, healthcare providers can optimize patient outcomes and minimize bleeding risks. Additionally, this review identifies the need for further research to bridge current knowledge gaps in clinical pharmacology related to ASMs and bleeding disorders.

abstract: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN) are debilitating autoimmune disorders characterized by pathological autoantibodies production and immune dysfunction, causing chronic inflammation and multi-organ damage. Despite current treatments with antimalarial drugs, glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants, and monoclonal antibodies, a definitive cure remains elusive, highlighting an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Recent studies indicate that chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has shown promising results in treating B-cell malignancies and may offer a significant breakthrough for non-malignant conditions like SLE. In this paper, we aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the advancements in CAR-T therapy for SLE, focusing on its potential to revolutionize treatment for this complex disease. We explore the fundamental mechanisms of CAR-T cell action, the rationale for its application in SLE, and the immunological underpinnings of the disease. We also summarize clinical data on the safety and efficacy of anti-CD19 and anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR-T cells in targeting B-cells in SLE. We discuss the clinical implications of these findings and the potential for CAR-T therapy to improve outcomes in severe or refractory SLE cases. The integration of CAR-T therapy into the SLE treatment paradigm presents a new horizon in autoimmunity research and clinical practice. This review underscores the need for continued exploration and optimization of CAR-T strategies to address the unmet needs of SLE patients.

abstract: Background: Neuropathic pain (NP) is a chronic condition caused by abnormal neuronal excitability in the nervous system. Current treatments for NP are often ineffective or poorly tolerated. Hence, we reviewed the efficacy and safety of novel drugs or devices that target neuronal excitability in NP patients compared with placebo, sham, or usual care interventions. Methods: Six databases were searched for parallel randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting novel devices (rTMS, SCS, and TENS) or drugs (EMA401, capsaicin 8% patch, and Sativex) for NP. Data were extracted and quality was assessed using the ROB2 tool. The random-effects inverse variance method was used for analysis. Results: In our review of 30 RCTs with 4251 participants, device-based interventions were found to be more effective in reducing pain scores than control interventions (SMD = -1.27, 95% CI: -1.92 to -0.62). However, high heterogeneity was seen (p < 0.01, I 2 = 91%), attributable to the etiology of NP (R 2 = 58.84%) and year of publication (R 2 = 49.49%). Funding source and type of control comparator were ruled out as cause of heterogeneity. Although drug interventions did not differ from placebo interventions in absolute pain reduction (SMD = -1.21, 95% CI: -3.55 to 1.13), when comparing relative change in pain intensity from baseline, drug interventions were found to be effective (SMD = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.04-0.55). Asymmetry in the funnel plot was visualized, suggesting publication bias. Certainty of evidence was very low according to GRADE assessment. Conclusions: Our review indicates that device-based interventions are more effective than control interventions in reducing pain intensity in NP. Nevertheless, available evidence is limited due to heterogeneity and publication bias, prompting the need for more high-quality RCTs to confirm the efficacy and safety of these interventions.

      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is treated with immediate primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) to restore coronary blood flow in the acutely ischaemic territory, but is associated with reperfusion injury limiting the benefit of the therapy. No treatment has proven effective in reducing reperfusion injury. Transcoronary hypothermia has been tested in clinical studies and is well tolerated, but is generally established after crossing the occlusion with a guidewire therefore after initial reperfusion, which might have contributed to the neutral outcomes. Transcatheter strategies may also offer additional benefit through haemodilution and the resultant controlled reperfusion, but this has not been fully investigated for pPCI.

abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine and metabolic disorder affecting 6-20% of women of childbearing age worldwide. Immune cell imbalance and dysregulation of inflammatory factors can lead to systematic low-grade chronic inflammation (SLCI), which plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. A significant higher infiltration of immune cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes and pro-inflammatory factors IL-6 and TNF-α has been detected in PCOS organ systems, impacting not only the female reproductive system but also other organs such as the cardiovascular, intestine, liver, thyroid, brain and other organs. Obesity, insulin resistance (IR), steroid hormones imbalance and intestinal microecological imbalance, deficiencies in vitamin D and selenium, as well as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) can induce systematic imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cells and molecules. The pro-inflammatory cells and cytokines also interact with obesity, steroid hormones imbalance and IR, leading to increased metabolic imbalance and reproductive-endocrine dysfunction in PCOS patients. This review aims to summarize the dysregulation of immune response in PCOS organ system and the intrinsic mechanisms affecting SLCI in PCOS to provide new insights for the systemic inflammatory treatment of PCOS in the future.

abstract: Microtubule assembly takes place at the centrosome and noncentrosomal microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs). However, the mechanisms controlling the activity of noncentrosomal MTOCs are poorly understood. Here, using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model organism, we demonstrate that the kinesin-14 motor Klp2 interacts with the J-domain Hsp70/Ssa1 cochaperone Rsp1, an inhibitory factor of microtubule assembly, and that Klp2 is required for the proper localization of Rsp1 to microtubules. In addition, we demonstrate that Klp2 is not required for the localization of Mto1, a factor promoting microtubule assembly, to microtubules. Moreover, Rsp1-Ssa1 inhibits the interaction of Mto1-Mto2 with the gamma-tubulin small complex. The absence of Klp2 reduces the colocalization of Rsp1 and Mto1 foci on preexisting microtubules, resulting in an increased microtubule-dependent microtubule assembly. Our results suggest that Klp2 regulates the activity of noncentrosomal MTOCs by targeting Rsp1 to the sites of Mto1 activity and reveal a mechanism for the inhibition of noncentrosomal microtubule assembly by a kinesin-14 motor.

abstract: Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors that has previously been linked to resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and more recently to immunotherapy. In particular, hypoxic tumors exclude T cells and inhibit their activity, suggesting that tumor cells acquire a mechanism to evade T-cell recognition and killing. Our analysis of hypoxic tumors indicates that hypoxia downregulates the expression of MHC class I and its bound peptides (i.e., the immunopeptidome). Hypoxia decreases MHC-I expression in an oxygen-dependent manner, via activation of autophagy through the PERK arm of the unfolded protein response. Using an immunopeptidomics-based LC-MS approach, we find a significant reduction of presented antigens under hypoxia. Inhibition of autophagy under hypoxia enhances antigen presentation. In experimental tumors, reducing mitochondrial metabolism through a respiratory complex-I inhibitor increases tumor oxygenation, as well as MHC-I levels and the immunopeptidome. These data explain the molecular basis of tumor immune evasion in hypoxic conditions, and have implications for future therapeutic interventions targeting hypoxia-induced alterations in antigen presentation.

abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating anti-cancer agents often lack generalizability to real-world oncology patients. Although restrictive eligibility criteria contribute to this issue, the role of selection bias related to prognostic risk remains unclear. In this study, we developed TrialTranslator, a framework designed to systematically evaluate the generalizability of RCTs for oncology therapies. Using a nationwide database of electronic health records from Flatiron Health, this framework emulates RCTs across three prognostic phenotypes identified through machine learning models. We applied this approach to 11 landmark RCTs that investigated anti-cancer regimens considered standard of care for the four most prevalent advanced solid malignancies. Our analyses reveal that patients in low-risk and medium-risk phenotypes exhibit survival times and treatment-associated survival benefits similar to those observed in RCTs. In contrast, high-risk phenotypes show significantly lower survival times and treatment-associated survival benefits compared to RCTs. Our results were corroborated by a comprehensive robustness assessment, including examinations of specific patient subgroups, holdout validation and semi-synthetic data simulation. These findings suggest that the prognostic heterogeneity among real-world oncology patients plays a substantial role in the limited generalizability of RCT results. Machine learning frameworks may facilitate individual patient-level decision support and estimation of real-world treatment benefits to guide trial design.

abstract: Understanding human endometrial dynamics in the establishment of endometrial receptivity remains a challenge, which limits early diagnosis and treatment of endometrial-factor infertility. Here, we decode the endometrial dynamics of fertile women across the window of implantation and characterize the endometrial deficiency in women with recurrent implantation failure. A computational model capable of both temporal prediction and pattern discovery is used to analyze single-cell transcriptomic data from over 220,000 endometrial cells. The time-series atlas highlights a two-stage stromal decidualization process and a gradual transitional process of the luminal epithelial cells across the window of implantation. In addition, a time-varying gene set regulating epithelium receptivity is identified, based on which the recurrent implantation failure endometria are stratified into two classes of deficiencies. Further investigation uncovers a hyper-inflammatory microenvironment for the dysfunctional endometrial epithelial cells of recurrent implantation failure. The holistic characterization of the physiological and pathophysiological window of implantation and a computational tool trained on this temporal atlas provide a platform for future therapeutic developments.

abstract: Ovarian lesions are common and often incidentally detected. A critical shortage of expert ultrasound examiners has raised concerns of unnecessary interventions and delayed cancer diagnoses. Deep learning has shown promising results in the detection of ovarian cancer in ultrasound images; however, external validation is lacking. In this international multicenter retrospective study, we developed and validated transformer-based neural network models using a comprehensive dataset of 17,119 ultrasound images from 3,652 patients across 20 centers in eight countries. Using a leave-one-center-out cross-validation scheme, for each center in turn, we trained a model using data from the remaining centers. The models demonstrated robust performance across centers, ultrasound systems, histological diagnoses and patient age groups, significantly outperforming both expert and non-expert examiners on all evaluated metrics, namely F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Cohen's kappa, Matthew's correlation coefficient, diagnostic odds ratio and Youden's J statistic. Furthermore, in a retrospective triage simulation, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven diagnostic support reduced referrals to experts by 63% while significantly surpassing the diagnostic performance of the current practice. These results show that transformer-based models exhibit strong generalization and above human expert-level diagnostic accuracy, with the potential to alleviate the shortage of expert ultrasound examiners and improve patient outcomes.

abstract: Early therapeutic intervention in high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (HR-SMM) has shown benefits, however, no studies have assessed whether biochemical progression or response depth predicts long-term outcomes. The single-arm I-PRISM phase II trial (NCT02916771) evaluated ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in 55 patients with HR-SMM. The primary endpoint, median progression-free survival (PFS), was not reached (NR) (95% CI: 57.7-NR, median follow-up 50 months). The secondary endpoint, biochemical PFS, was 48.6 months (95% CI: 39.9-NR) and coincided with or preceded SLiM-CRAB in eight patients. For additional secondary objectives, the overall response rate was 93% with 31% achieving complete response (CR) and 45% very good partial response (VGPR) or better. CR correlated strongly with the absence of SLiM-CRAB and biochemical progression. MRD-negativity (10-5 sensitivity) predicted a 5-year biochemical PFS of 100% versus 40% in MRD-positive patients (p = 0.051), demonstrating that deep responses significantly improve time to progression. Exploratory single-cell RNA sequencing linked tumor MHC class I expression to proteasome inhibitor response, and a lower proportion of GZMB+ T cells within clonally expanded CD8+ T cells associated with suboptimal outcomes.

abstract: Identifying cell types and brain regions critical for psychiatric disorders and brain traits is essential for targeted neurobiological research. By integrating genomic insights from genome-wide association studies with a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the adult human brain, we prioritized specific neuronal clusters significantly enriched for the SNP-heritabilities for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder along with intelligence, education, and neuroticism. Extrapolation of cell-type results to brain regions reveals the whole-brain impact of schizophrenia genetic risk, with subregions in the hippocampus and amygdala exhibiting the most significant enrichment of SNP-heritability. Using functional MRI connectivity, we further confirmed the significance of the central and lateral amygdala, hippocampal body, and prefrontal cortex in distinguishing schizophrenia cases from controls. Our findings underscore the value of single-cell transcriptomics in understanding the polygenicity of psychiatric disorders and suggest a promising alignment of genomic, transcriptomic, and brain imaging modalities for identifying common biological targets.

      Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with antiangiogenic drugs have shown promising outcomes in the third-line and subsequent treatments of patients with microsatellite stable metastatic colorectal cancer (MSS-mCRC). Radiotherapy (RT) may enhance the antitumor effect of immunotherapy. However, the effect of RT exposure on patients receiving ICIs and targeted therapy remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between RT exposure and clinical responses to fruquintinib (a highly selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) plus sintilimab (an anti-programmed death 1 antibody; F&S) in previously treated patients with MSS-mCRC and to explore predictive biomarkers.

abstract: The combined use of tocilizumab (TCZ) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancer treatment is gaining attention, but preclinical studies are lacking. Our study aims to investigate the synergistic anti-tumor effect of TCZ combined with ICIs and its role in treating immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The clinical significance of high interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression in tumor patients was analyzed from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The expression levels of IL-6 were compared before and during the onset of ICIs-associated myocarditis patients. ICIs-related myocardial inflammatory injury and therapeutic lung cancer models were constructed in C57BL/6 J mice using murine-derived programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors alone or in combination with TCZ. Possible inflammatory mechanisms were proposed and validated. The anti-tumor effects and mechanisms of both drugs in combination were assessed. Patients with high IL-6 expression had a poor prognosis, and those with ICIs-associated myocarditis exhibited elevated IL-6 from baseline. In the PD-1 inhibitors-associated myocardial inflammatory injury mouse model, the levels of IL-6 in the blood and cardiac tissues were significantly elevated. TCZ ameliorated immune myocardial inflammatory injury by inhibiting the IL-6/janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of the transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. The group treated with PD-1 inhibitors combined with TCZ showed significantly slower tumor growth than that treated with PD-1 inhibitors alone. TCZ resisted tumor growth by inhibiting the IL-6-JAK2-STAT3 pathway. By targeting the IL-6-JAK2-STAT3 pathway, TCZ can alleviate PD-1 inhibitors-associated myocardial inflammatory injury mediated by M1-polarized macrophages and plays a synergistic anti-tumor role by inhibiting lung cancer cell proliferation.

abstract: The complex set of interactions between the immune system and metabolism, known as immunometabolism, has emerged as a critical regulator of disease outcomes in the central nervous system. Numerous studies have linked metabolic disturbances to impaired immune responses in brain aging, neurodegenerative disorders, and brain injury. In this review, we will discuss how disruptions in brain immunometabolism balance contribute to the pathophysiology of brain dysfunction. The first part of the review summarizes the contributions of critical immune cell populations such as microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells in mediating inflammation and metabolism in CNS disorders. The remainder of the review addresses the impact of metabolic changes on immune cell activation and disease progression in brain aging, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, we also address the therapeutic potential of targeting immunometabolic pathways to reduce neuroinflammation and slow disease progression. By focusing on the interactions among brain immune cells and the metabolic mechanisms they recruit in disease, we present a comprehensive overview of brain immunometabolism in human health and disease.

abstract: Gut microbiota regulates the immune system, the development and progression of autoimmune diseases (AIDs) and overall health. Recent studies have played a crucial part in understanding the specific role of different gut bacterial strains and their metabolites in different AIDs. Microbial signatures in AIDs are revealed by advanced sequencing and metabolomics studies. Microbes such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Akkermansia muciniphila, Anaerostipes caccae, Bacteroides sp., Roseburia sp., Blautia sp., Blautia faecis, Clostridium lavalense, Christensenellaceae sp., Coprococcus sp., Firmicutes sp., Ruminococcaceae sp., Lachnospiraceae sp., Megamonas sp., Monoglobus sp., Streptococcus pneumoniae and Bifidobacterium sp. help maintain immune homeostasis; whereas, Prevotella copri, Ruminococcus gnavus, Lactobacillus salivarius, Enterococcus gallinarum, Elizabeth menigoseptica, Collinsella sp., Escherichia sp., Fusobacterium sp., Enterobacter ludwigii, Enterobacteriaceae sp., Proteobacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas nigrescens, Dorea sp., and Clostridium sp. cause immuno-pathogenesis. A complex web of interactions is revealed by understanding the influence of gut microbiota on immune cells and various T cell subsets such as CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, natural killer T cells, γδ T cells, etc. Certain AIDs, including rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, atopic asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease exhibit a state of dysbiosis, characterized by alterations in microbial diversity and relative abundance of specific taxa. This review summarizes recent developments in understanding the role of certain microbiota composition in specific AIDs, and the factors affecting specific regulatory T cells through certain microbial metabolites and also focuses the potential application and therapeutic significance of gut microbiota-based interventions as novel adjunctive therapies for AIDs. Further research to determine the precise association of each gut bacterial strain in specific diseases is required.

abstract: Yellow seed coat color (SCC) is a valuable trait in Brassica napus, which is significantly correlated to high seed oil content (SOC) and low seed lignocellulose content (SLC). However, no dominant yellow SCC genes were identified in B. napus. In this study, a dominant yellow SCC B. napus N53-2 was verified, and then 58,981 eQTLs and 25 trans-eQTL hotspots were identified in a double haploid population derived from N53-2 and black SCC material Ken-C8. A rare dominant allele DYSOC1 (dominant gene of yellow seed coat color and improved seed oil content 1) was subsequently cloned in a trans-eQTL hotspot that colocated with SCC, SOC, and SLC QTL hotspot on ChrA09 through QTL fine mapping and multi-omics analysis. Transgenic experiments revealed that the expression of DYSOC1 produced yellow SCC seeds with significantly increased SOC and decreased SLC. Our result provides a rare dominant yellow SCC allele in B. napus, which has excellent potential for yellow SCC and high SOC rapeseed breeding.

abstract: WNT/β-catenin signaling plays key roles in development and cancer1,2. ZNRF3/RNF43 modulates Frizzleds through ubiquitination, dampening WNT/β-catenin signaling. Conversely, RSPO1-4 binding to LGR4-6 and ZNRF3/RNF43 enhances WNT/β-catenin signaling3-5. Here, we elucidate the overall landscape of architectures in multiple LGR4, RSPO2, and ZNRF3 assemblies, showcasing varying stoichiometries and arrangements. These structures reveal that LGR4 and RSPO2 capture distinct states of ZNRF3. The intrinsic heterogeneity of the LGR4-RSPO2-ZNRF3 assembly is influenced by LGR4 content. Particularly, in the assembly complex with a 2:2:2 ratio, two LGR4 protomers induce and stabilize the inactive state of ZNRF3, characterized by a wide inward-open conformation of two transmembrane helices (TM helices). This specific assembly promotes a stable complex, facilitating LGR4-induced endocytosis of ZNRF3. In contrast, the active dimeric ZNRF3, bound by a single LGR4, adopts a coiled-coil TM helices conformation and dimerization of RING domains. Our findings unveil how LGR4 content mediates diverse assemblies, leading to conformational rearrangements in ZNRF3 to regulate WNT/β-catenin signaling, and provide a structural foundation for drug development targeting Wnt-driven cancers.

abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading dementia among the elderly with complex origins. Despite extensive investigation into the AD-associated protein-coding genes, the involvement of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and posttranscriptional modification (PTM) in AD pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we comprehensively characterized the landscape of ncRNAs and PTM events in 1460 samples across six brain regions sourced from the Mount Sinai/JJ Peters VA Medical Center Brain Bank Study and Mayo cohorts, encompassing 33,321 long ncRNAs, 92,897 enhancer RNAs, 53,763 alternative polyadenylation events, and 900,221 A-to-I RNA editing events. We additionally identified 25,351 aberrantly expressed ncRNAs and altered PTM events associated with AD traits and further identified the corresponding protein-coding genes to construct regulatory networks. Furthermore, we developed a user-friendly data portal, ADatlas, facilitating users in exploring our results. Our study aims to establish a comprehensive data platform for ncRNAs and PTMs in AD to advance related research.

abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA), the most prevalent degenerative joint disease, is marked by cartilage degradation and pathological alterations in surrounding tissues. Currently, no effective disease-modifying treatments exist. This study aimed to elucidate the critical roles of Myb-like, SWIRM, and MPN domains 1 (MYSM1) and its downstream effector, Receptor-interacting protein kinase 2 (RIPK2), in OA pathogenesis and the underlying mechanisms. Our findings revealed reduced MYSM1 levels in the cartilage of OA patients and mouse models. Genetic or adenovirus-induced MYSM1 knockout exacerbated OA progression in mice, whereas MYSM1 overexpression mitigated it. Mechanistically, MYSM1 inhibited the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Conversely, downstream RIPK2 significantly increased OA-like phenotypes and activated the NF-κB and MAPK pathways. The Ripk2S176D mutation accelerated OA pathogenesis, while Ripk2 silencing or Ripk2S176A mutation deactivated NF-κB and MAPK pathways, counteracting the role of MYSM1. MYSM1 deubiquitinates and dephosphorylates RIPK2S176 by recruiting protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A). These results suggest that targeting MYSM1 or downstream RIPK2 offers promising therapeutic potential for OA.

abstract: The dynamics of the genetic diversity of pathogens, including the emergence of lineages with increased fitness, is a foundational concept of disease ecology with key public-health implications. However, the identification of such lineages and estimation of associated fitness remain challenging, and is rarely done outside densely sampled systems1,2. Here we present phylowave, a scalable approach that summarizes changes in population composition in phylogenetic trees, enabling the automatic detection of lineages based on shared fitness and evolutionary relationships. We use our approach on a broad set of viruses and bacteria (SARS-CoV-2, influenza A subtype H3N2, Bordetella pertussis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis), which include both well-studied and understudied threats to human health. We show that phylowave recovers the main known circulating lineages for each pathogen and that it can detect specific amino acid changes linked to fitness changes. Furthermore, phylowave identifies previously undetected lineages with increased fitness, including three co-circulating B. pertussis lineages. Inference using phylowave is robust to uneven and limited observations. This widely applicable approach provides an avenue to monitor evolution in real time to support public-health action and explore fundamental drivers of pathogen fitness.

abstract: Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by a decline in endothelial physiological functions, is a significant aspect of cardiovascular aging, contributing notably to arterial stiffness, atherosclerosis, and hypertension. Transient receptor potential channel V4 (TRPV4), a key member of Ca2+-permeable channels, plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular functions. However, the role and mechanisms of TRPV4 in aging-related endothelial dysfunction remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrated a marked reduction in endothelial TRPV4 function without alterations in its expression, leading to abnormal endothelial Ca2+ signaling and impaired vasodilation in aging mesenteric arteries. Employing transcriptome sequencing, co-IP, and PLA assays, we characterized G protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) interacting with TRPV4, and abnormally enhanced interactions were found in aging endothelial cells. Subsequently, we revealed that intensive GPR35-TRPV4 interaction significantly contributes to endothelial dysfunction during aging, utilizing TRPV4 endothelial-specific knockout (TRPV4EC -/-), AAV-FLT1-shRNA (GPR35) mice, and GPR35 overexpressed/knocked-down HUVECs. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis and subsequent co-IP and pressure myograph experiments indicated that both Thonningianin A and Carfilzomib efficiently restored the GPR35-TRPV4 interaction, preventing endothelial dysfunction and vasodilation impairment. Our study identifies the crucial role of GPR35-TRPV4 interaction in aging-associated abnormal endothelial function and vascular tone modulation. Restoring GPR35-TRPV4 interaction via Thonningianin A or Carfilzomib represents a promising precision approach for aging-related endothelial dysfunction.

abstract: Nowadays androgenetic alopecia (AGA) has become a common concern of affected subjects of both sexes. Finasteride is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of male AGA. There is no clear evidence to support the use of dutasteride in male AGA. In female AGA, the effectiveness of dutasteride and finasteride is still under debate, and there is no clear evidence to use any of them in female AGA. A systematic review was conducted to compare dutasteride and finasteride in treating both male and female AGA and their efficacy, safety, and side effects with effective dosage. The review was done using several databases including: PubMed, Ovid Medline, Google Scholar, and Cochrane, using the following search terms/key words: "Dutasteride", "Finasteride", "Male pattern hair loss", "Female pattern hair loss", "Efficacy", "Tolerability", "Side effects", and "Comparison". Articles related to the efficacy, tolerability, and side effects of dutasteride and finasteride in the treatment of male and female AGA were specifically sought, considering the doses used for each medication. The review encompassed a total of nine studies. Four randomized controlled trials, one single-arm trial, two prospective cohorts, and two retrospective cohort studies. Seven studies exclusively enrolled male participants, while only two included female participants. All groups receiving various doses of dutasteride and finasteride exhibited a significant increase in hair count compared to the placebo group. Notably, dutasteride (0.5 mg) and dutasteride (2.5 mg) were significantly more effective than finasteride (1 mg) in increasing hair counts. Furthermore, no significant difference in adverse events was observed between finasteride and dutasteride. Dutasteride is more potent than finasteride in treating AGA in both males and females. All the adverse events between finasteride and dutasteride were comparable.

abstract: Yes-associated protein (YAP) activation confers resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Methionine participates in cellular processes by converting to methyl donor for the methylation of DNA, RNA and protein. However, it remains unclear whether methionine affects drug resistance by influencing YAP activity. In this study, we report that methionine deprivation remarkably suppresses the transcriptional activity of YAP-TEAD in cancer cells. Methionine promotes PRMT1-catalyzed asymmetric dimethylation at R124 of YAP (YAP R124me2a). Mimicking of YAP methylation abolishes the reduction effect of methionine-restricted diet on YAP-induced drug resistance. YAP activates the transcription of SLC43A2, the methionine transporter, to increase methionine uptake in cancer cells. Knockdown of SLC43A2 decreases the level of YAP R124me2a. BCH, the inhibitor of SLC43A2, sensitizes tumors to anticancer drugs. Thus, our results unravel the positive feedback between YAP R124 methylation and SLC43A2 that contributes to anticancer drug resistance. Disrupting this positive feedback could be a potential strategy for cancer therapy.

abstract: Genome editing using CRISPR-Cas systems is a promising avenue for the treatment of genetic diseases. However, cellular and humoral immunogenicity of genome editing tools, which originate from bacteria, complicates their clinical use. Here we report reduced immunogenicity (Red)(i)-variants of two clinically relevant nucleases, SaCas9 and AsCas12a. Through MHC-associated peptide proteomics (MAPPs) analysis, we identify putative immunogenic epitopes on each nuclease. Using computational modeling, we rationally design these proteins to evade the immune response. SaCas9 and AsCas12a Redi variants are substantially less recognized by adaptive immune components, including reduced binding affinity to MHC molecules and attenuated generation of cytotoxic T cell responses, yet maintain wild-type levels of activity and specificity. In vivo editing of PCSK9 with SaCas9.Redi.1 is comparable in efficiency to wild-type SaCas9, but significantly reduces undesired immune responses. This demonstrates the utility of this approach in engineering proteins to evade immune detection.

abstract: With the ongoing rise in the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), its extraintestinal manifestations have garnered significant attention. IBD-related arthritis is notable for its insidious onset and unpredictability, presenting considerable challenges for clinical diagnosis and management. Factors such as gut microbiota, plasma proteins, inflammatory proteins, and biomarkers found in blood and urine may be closely associated with IBD-related arthritis. However, the mechanisms by which these factors influence this condition remain poorly understood and require urgent investigation. We employed the method of linkage disequilibrium and the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, utilizing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified from large-scale genome-wide association studies as instrumental variables. In this scientifically rigorous manner, we explored the potential causal relationship between gut microbiota, plasma proteins, inflammatory proteins, and blood and urine biomarkers in relation to arthritis resulting from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This method aids in elucidating the potential roles of these biomarkers in the development of arthritis following IBD, while minimizing the confounding factors and reverse causality commonly encountered in observational studies. To further verify and strengthen our findings, we conducted subsequent sensitivity analyses. These analyses will evaluate the strength of the association between SNPs and the studied biomarkers, as well as post-IBD arthritis, while accounting for variations in SNP distribution among populations and other potential genetic influencing factors. Through these rigorous analytical steps, our objective is to enhance the robustness and credibility of the research findings and provide more reliable scientific evidence regarding the pathogenesis of post-IBD arthritis. MR analysis provides evidence for the association between genetically predicted gut microbiota, plasma proteins, inflammatory proteins, and blood and urine biomarkers with the risk of IBD-related arthritis. This analysis investigates the characteristics of the associations between specific gut microbiota, plasma proteins, inflammatory proteins, and blood and urine biomarkers in relation to IBD-related arthritis. Among the plasma proteins, pterin-4-alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase, aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C4, cathepsin L2, angiostatin, hepatocyte growth factor-like protein, hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2, protein O-linked mannose beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2, epididymal-specific alpha-mannosidase, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-like protein are associated with Crohn's disease-related arthritis. In contrast, agrin, methylenetetrahydrofolate synthetase domain-containing protein, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) growth factor receptor, and neuropilin-1 are associated with ulcerative colitis-related arthritis. Furthermore, regarding gut bacterial pathway abundance, adenosylcobalamin, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylmannosamine, and N-acetylneuraminic acid degradation, as well as glycolysis metabolism and degradation pathways, are associated with Crohn's disease-related arthritis. Meanwhile, gut bacterial pathway abundance (pentose phosphate pathway) and gut microbiota abundance (Bacteroidetes, Bacteroidia, Bacteroidales, Porphyromonadaceae, Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium eligens) are linked to ulcerative colitis-related arthritis. Notably, we did not identify any connections between inflammatory protein factors, blood and urine biomarkers, and IBD-related arthritis. Lastly, in the reverse MR study, the insufficient number of SNPs available for analysis precluded the detection of a reverse causal relationship. This study employs the MR method to elucidate the potential causal relationships among gut microbiota, plasma proteins, inflammatory proteins, and blood and urine biomarkers in relation to the occurrence and progression of IBD-related arthritis. This research offers a novel perspective for a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD-related arthritis and highlights future directions for the diagnosis and treatment strategies of this condition.

abstract: We have previously reported that high-alcohol-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (HiAlc Kpn) in the gut can cause endo-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Here, we discover that 91.2% of Kpn isolates from pulmonary disease samples also produce excess ethanol, which may be associated with respiratory disease severity. To further explore the potential mechanism, a murine model is established with high-dose bacteria. Kpn stimulates granular neutrophils (G0), subsequently transforming them into phagocytic neutrophils (G1). HiAlc Kpn also causes dysfunction of pyrimidine metabolism, leading to neutrophil apoptosis. These changes inhibit phagocytosis of neutrophils and possibly suppress inflammasome-dependent innate immunity. In a persistent infective murine model, HiAlc Kpn induces lung fibrosis and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), possibly affecting epithelial cell apoptosis and lung function. The results suggest that the subtype of neutrophil is a potential biomarker for the severity of lung injury caused by HiAlc Kpn.

abstract: Transgenic expression of a double-stranded RNA in plants can induce silencing of homologous mRNAs in fungal pathogens. Although such host-induced gene silencing is well documented, the molecular mechanisms by which RNAs can move from the cytoplasm of plant cells across the plasma membrane of both the host cell and fungal cell are poorly understood. Indirect evidence suggests that this RNA transfer may occur at a very early stage of the infection process, prior to breach of the host cell wall, suggesting that silencing RNAs might be secreted onto leaf surfaces. To assess whether Arabidopsis plants possess a mechanism for secreting RNA onto leaf surfaces, we developed a protocol for isolating leaf surface RNA separately from intercellular (apoplastic) RNA. This protocol yielded abundant leaf surface RNA that displayed an RNA banding pattern distinct from apoplastic RNA, suggesting that it may be secreted directly onto the leaf surface rather than exuded through stomata or hydathodes. Notably, this RNA was not associated with either extracellular vesicles or protein complexes; however, RNA species longer than 100 nucleotides could be pelleted by ultracentrifugation. Furthermore, pelleting was inhibited by the divalent cation chelator EGTA, suggesting that these RNAs may form condensates on the leaf surface. These leaf surface RNAs are derived almost exclusively from Arabidopsis, but come from diverse genomic sources, including rRNA, tRNA, mRNA, intergenic RNA, microRNAs, and small interfering RNAs, with tRNAs especially enriched. We speculate that endogenous leaf surface RNA plays an important role in the assembly of distinct microbial communities on leaf surfaces.

abstract: Plant roots perceive heat stress (HS) and adapt their architecture accordingly, which in turn influence the yield in crops. Investigating their heterogeneity and cell type-specific response to HS is essential for improving crop resilience. Here, we generate single-cell transcriptional landscape of maize (Zea mays) roots in response to HS. We characterize 15 cell clusters corresponding to 9 major cell types and identify cortex as the main root cell type responsive to HS with the most differentially expressed genes and its trajectory being preferentially affected upon HS. We find that cortex size strongly correlated with heat tolerance that is experimentally validated by using inbred lines and genetic mutation analysis of one candidate gene in maize, providing potential HS tolerance indicator and targets for crop improvement. Moreover, interspecies comparison reveals conserved root cell types and core markers in response to HS in plants, which are experimentally validated. These results provide a universal atlas for unraveling the transcriptional programs that specify and maintain the cell identity of maize roots in response to HS at a cell type-specific level.

abstract: Aging is associated with increased tumor metastasis and poor prognosis. However, how an aging immune system contributes to the process is unclear. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that in male mice, aging shifts the lung immune microenvironment towards a premetastatic niche, characterized by an increased proportion of IL-17-expressing γδT (γδ17) and neutrophils. Mechanistically, age-dependent downregulation of the immune trafficking receptor S1pr1 drives the expansion of γδ17. Compared to young mice, expanded γδ17 recruit tumor-promoting neutrophils with lower expression levels of CD62L and higher levels of C-kit and CXCR4. These neutrophils suppress the stemness and tumor-killing functions of CD8+ T cells in aged male mice. Accordingly, antibody-mediated depletion of γδT or neutrophils reduces tumor metastatic foci in aged animals, and the administration of the senolytic agent procyanidin C1 reverses the observed immune-mediated, tumor-promoting effects of aging. Thus, we uncover a γδ17-Neutrophil-CD8 axis that promotes aging-driven tumor metastasis in male mice and provides potential insights for managing metastatic tumors.

abstract: Glioblastoma is an incurable brain malignancy. By the time of clinical diagnosis, these tumours exhibit a degree of genetic and cellular heterogeneity that provides few clues to the mechanisms that initiate and drive gliomagenesis1,2. Here, to explore the early steps in gliomagenesis, we utilized conditional gene deletion and lineage tracing in tumour mouse models, coupled with serial magnetic resonance imaging, to initiate and then closely track tumour formation. We isolated labelled and unlabelled cells at multiple stages-before the first visible abnormality, at the time of the first visible lesion, and then through the stages of tumour growth-and subjected cells of each stage to single-cell profiling. We identify a malignant cell state with a neural crest-like gene expression signature that is highly abundant in the early stages, but relatively diminished in the late stage of tumour growth. Genomic analysis based on the presence of copy number alterations suggests that these neural crest-like states exist as part of a heterogeneous clonal hierarchy that evolves with tumour growth. By exploring the injury response in wounded normal mouse brains, we identify cells with a similar signature that emerge following injury and then disappear over time, suggesting that activation of an injury response program occurs during tumorigenesis. Indeed, our experiments reveal a non-malignant injury-like microenvironment that is initiated in the brain following oncogene activation in cerebral precursor cells. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the early stages of glioblastoma, identifying a unique cell state and an injury response program tied to early tumour formation. These findings have implications for glioblastoma therapies and raise new possibilities for early diagnosis and prevention of disease.

abstract: The discovery of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) within tumor tissues provides a promising avenue to promote the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Yet, the lack of effective strategies to induce TLS formation poses a substantial obstacle. Thus, the exploration of potential inducers for TLS formation is of great interest but remains challenging. Here, inspired by the mechanism of artificially cultivated pearls, a covalent organic framework (COF) is employed to induce TLS formation. Single-cell sequencing analysis reveals that this is achieved by promotion of cytokine hypersecretion, which facilitates the maturation, proliferation, and migration of T and B cells, critical for triggering TLS formation. Furthermore, the efficacy of COF-mediated phototherapy in inducing TLS formation is validated in both the MC38 and 4MOSC1 female tumor models. Notably, a strong synergistic effect between COF-mediated phototherapy and αCTLA-4 is observed, resulting in the effective eradication of both primary and distant tumors, while also inhibiting tumor recurrence.

abstract: Humans are widely exposed to phthalates, a common chemical plasticizer. Previous cohort studies have revealed that maternal exposure to monobutyl phthalate (MBP), a key metabolite of phthalates, is associated with neurodevelopmental defects. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that maternal exposure to MBP enhances neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation into astrocytes with highly expressed C3 and LCN2 in mouse offspring, resulting in increased synapse phagocytosis and cognitive dysfunction. Mechanistically, we find that MBP exposure activates the IRE1α/XBP1s (spliced XBP1) stress response pathway, which regulates key genes involved in astrocyte differentiation (SOX9 and ATF3) and reactivity (C3 and LCN2). Conditional knockout or pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α markedly inhibits NSC differentiation into astrocytes and astrocyte reactivity, attenuates synapse phagocytosis, and improves cognitive function. This phenotype is further recapitulated in a human brain organoid model. Together, these findings unveil the molecular mechanism underlying the neurodevelopmental deficits caused by a widespread environmental pollutant.

abstract: Defining the subcellular distribution of all human proteins and their remodeling across cellular states remains a central goal in cell biology. Here, we present a high-resolution strategy to map subcellular organization using organelle immunocapture coupled to mass spectrometry. We apply this workflow to a cell-wide collection of membranous and membraneless compartments. A graph-based analysis assigns the subcellular localization of over 7,600 proteins, defines spatial networks, and uncovers interconnections between cellular compartments. Our approach can be deployed to comprehensively profile proteome remodeling during cellular perturbation. By characterizing the cellular landscape following HCoV-OC43 viral infection, we discover that many proteins are regulated by changes in their spatial distribution rather than by changes in abundance. Our results establish that proteome-wide analysis of subcellular remodeling provides key insights for elucidating cellular responses, uncovering an essential role for ferroptosis in OC43 infection. Our dataset can be explored at organelles.czbiohub.org.

abstract: Recent studies suggest cGAS-STING pathway may play a crucial role in the genesis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), closely associated with classical pathways and tumor immunity. We aimed to develop models predicting survival and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 outcomes centered on the cGAS-STING pathway in HCC. We identified classical pathways highly correlated with cGAS-STING pathway and constructed transformer survival model preserving raw structure of pathways. We also developed explainable XGBoost model for predicting anti-PD-1/PD-L1 outcomes using SHAP algorithm. We trained and validated transformer survival model on pan-cancer cohort and tested it on three independent HCC cohorts. Using 0.5 as threshold across cohorts, we divided each HCC cohort into two groups and calculated P values with log-rank test. TCGA-LIHC: C-index = 0.750, P = 1.52e-11; ICGC-LIRI-JP: C-index = 0.741, P = .00138; GSE144269: C-index = 0.647, P = .0233. We trained and validated [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.777] XGBoost model on immunotherapy datasets and tested it on GSE78220 (AUC = 0.789); we also tested XGBoost model on HCC anti-PD-L1 cohort (AUC = 0.719). Our deep learning model and XGBoost model demonstrate potential in predicting survival risks and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 outcomes in HCC. We deployed these two prediction models to the GitHub repository and provided detailed instructions for their usage: deep learning survival model, https://github.com/mlwalker123/CSP_survival_model; XGBoost immunotherapy model, https://github.com/mlwalker123/CSP_immunotherapy_model.

abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complex metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia. Recently, the incidence of diabetes has increased exponentially, and it is estimated to become the seventh leading cause of global mortality by 2030. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a hormone derived from the intestine, has been demonstrated to exert remarkable hypoglycemic effects. However, its limitation lies in its short plasma half-life, necessitating the continuous intravenous injection of GLP-1 drugs to achieve efficacy. Here, we engineered Clostridium butyricum to continuously express and deliver GLP-1 (denoted as Cb-GLP-1), and assessed its therapeutic efficacy in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. We demonstrated that administration of Cb-GLP-1 effectively lowered blood glucose levels, regulated dyslipidemia, and ameliorated hepatic impairment in T2DM mice. Furthermore, Cb-GLP-1 treatment facilitated insulin secretion by retarding islet cell apoptosis and activating the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor/adenylate cyclase/protein kinase A (GLP-1 R/AC/PKA) signaling pathway. Gut microbiota analysis revealed that Cb-GLP-1 restored gut homeostasis disrupted in T2DM mice, as indicated by the decreased abundance of Lactobacillus and Providencia genera in response to Cb-GLP-1 treatment. Collectively, the intestinal microbiota regulation and hypoglycemic effect of the engineered strain Cb-GLP-1 presents a promising approach for diabetes management.

abstract: The NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a crucial role in human acute and chronic liver diseases. However, the role and cell-specific contribution of NLRP3 in liver regeneration remains unclear. Here, we found that NLRP3 was highly activated during the early stage of liver regeneration via 70% partial hepatectomy (PHx) mice model and clinical data. Global NLRP3 depletion or pharmacologically blocking NLRP3 significantly enhanced liver regeneration, while NLRP3 overexpression impaired it after PHx. Furthermore, mice with myeloid-specific knockout of Nlrp3 (Nlrp3Δmye), rather than hepatocyte-specific knockout (Nlrp3Δhep), showed improved liver regeneration compared to control (Nlrp3fl/fl). Mechanistically, deficiency of Nlrp3 promoted myeloid-epithelial-reproductive tyrosine kinase (MerTK)-mediated efferocytosis, thereby inducing macrophages toward a pro-reparative Ly6Clo phenotype. Notably, NLRP3 inhibition by MCC950 effectively reversed the impairment of liver regeneration after PHx in mice fed a high-fat diet. Our findings provide a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of post-hepatectomy liver failure.

abstract: Synaptic configurations underpin how the nervous system processes sensory information to produce a behavioral response. This is best understood for chemical synapses, and we know far less about how electrical synaptic configurations modulate sensory information processing and context-specific behaviors. We discovered that innexin 1 (INX-1), a gap junction protein that forms electrical synapses, is required to deploy context-specific behavioral strategies underlying thermotaxis behavior in C. elegans. Within this well-defined circuit, INX-1 couples two bilaterally symmetric interneurons to integrate sensory information during migratory behavior across temperature gradients. In inx-1 mutants, uncoupled interneurons display increased excitability and responses to subthreshold sensory stimuli due to increased membrane resistance and reduced membrane capacitance, resulting in abnormal responses that extend run durations and trap the animals in context-irrelevant tracking of isotherms. Thus, a conserved configuration of electrical synapses enables differential processing of sensory information to deploy context-specific behavioral strategies.

abstract: Current desensitization and maintenance immunosuppression regimens for kidney transplantation in sensitized individuals show limited ability to control the posttransplant humoral response, resulting in high rates of antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) and graft failure. Here, we showed that anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based immunosuppression more effectively controlled allograft rejection and humoral rebound in a highly sensitized nonhuman primate kidney transplantation model compared with tacrolimus-based standard-of-care (SOC) immunosuppression. Desensitization with an anti-CD154 mAb (5C8) and a proteasome inhibitor led to decreased donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) and disruption of lymph node germinal centers with reduction of proliferating, memory, and class-switched B cells as well as T follicular helper cells. After transplant, the nonhuman primates maintained on 5C8-based immunosuppression had significantly better survival compared with those maintained on SOC immunosuppression (135.2 days versus 32.8 days, P = 0.013). The 5C8-treated group demonstrated better suppression of DSAs after transplant, more robust suppression of B cell populations, and better induction of regulatory T cells. Fewer infectious and welfare complications, including viral reactivation and weight loss, were also observed with 5C8-based immunosuppression compared with SOC immunosuppression. Therefore, anti-CD154 mAbs may improve kidney transplant outcomes through better control of posttransplant immune responses. The superior efficacy of anti-CD154 mAb-based immunosuppression over tacrolimus-based SOC seen in this highly sensitized NHP transplant model suggests that anti-CD154 mAbs could potentially be used to desensitize and treat highly sensitized patients receiving kidney transplantation.

abstract: DCUN1D5 is up-regulated and promotes tumor progression in many cancers such as laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer, but the expression of DCUN1D5 in lung adenocarcinoma and its molecular mechanism are not clear. The differences of DCUN1D5 expression between lung adenocarcinoma and normal tissues were compared by TCGA, GEO and UALCAN databases, and the relationship between DCUN1D5 expression and clinicopathological features of patients was analyzed. The diagnostic and prognostic value of DCUN1D5 in patients with LUAD was analyzed by TCGA, GEPIA and Kaplan-Meier Plotter database. nomogram was constructed to predict the survival probability of patients. The GO, KEGG and GSEA enrichment analysis of DCUN1D5 co-expression genes were completed by R software. R software and GEPIA2 database were used to analyze the relationship between DCUN1D5 expression level and glycolysis-related genes and immune cell infiltration in patients with LUAD. The effects of interfering DCUN1D5 on the biological function and glycolysis level of lung adenocarcinoma cells were evaluated in vitro. The effect of down-regulation of DCUN1D5 on tumor formation in nude mice was studied in animal experiments. The expression of DCUN1D5 was increased in many kinds of tumors, and the expression in lung adenocarcinoma was significantly higher than that in normal tissues. The expression of DCUN1D5 was significantly correlated with TNM and pathological stage. DCUNN1D5 can play a diagnostic role in patients with LUAD and the prognosis of patients with high expression of DCUN1D5 is poor. Functional enrichment of DCUN1D5 co-expression genes involves a variety of biological processes. There is a strong correlation between DCUN1D5 and most glycolysis related genes. In addition, DCUN1D5 also affects tumor immune cell infiltration. In vitro experiments showed that the ability of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis were significantly decreased and the ability of apoptosis was enhanced after down-regulation of DCUN1D5. Animal experiments showed that the tumor weight of nude mice decreased significantly after down-regulation of DCUN1D5. DCUN1D5 can be used as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma. Down-regulation of DCUN1D5 can significantly affect the biological behavior of lung adenocarcinoma cells, which may be related to glycolysis and immune cell infiltration.

abstract: Molecular subtypes, such as defined by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), delineate a cancer's underlying biology, bringing hope to inform a patient's prognosis and treatment plan. However, most approaches used in the discovery of subtypes are not suitable for assigning subtype labels to new cancer specimens from other studies or clinical trials. Here, we address this barrier by applying five different machine learning approaches to multi-omic data from 8,791 TCGA tumor samples comprising 106 subtypes from 26 different cancer cohorts to build models based upon small numbers of features that can classify new samples into previously defined TCGA molecular subtypes-a step toward molecular subtype application in the clinic. We validate select classifiers using external datasets. Predictive performance and classifier-selected features yield insight into the different machine-learning approaches and genomic data platforms. For each cancer and data type we provide containerized versions of the top-performing models as a public resource.

abstract: Loss of Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). BAG3 regulates sarcomere protein turnover in cardiomyocytes; however, the function of BAG3 in other cardiac cell types is understudied. In this study, we used an isogenic pair of BAG3-knockout and wild-type human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to interrogate the role of BAG3 in hiPSC-derived cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Analysis of cell type-specific conditional knockout engineered heart tissues revealed an essential contribution of CF BAG3 to contractility and cardiac fibrosis, recapitulating the phenotype of DCM. In BAG3-/- CFs, we observed an increased sensitivity to TGF-β signaling and activation of a fibrogenic response when cultured at physiological stiffness (8 kPa). Mechanistically, we showed that loss of BAG3 increased transforming growth factor-β receptor 2 (TGFBR2) levels by directly binding TGFBR2 and mediating its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. To further validate these results, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing of cardiac tissue from DCM patients carrying pathogenic BAG3 variants. BAG3 pathogenic variants increased fibrotic gene expression in CFs. Together, these results extend our understanding of the roles of BAG3 in heart disease beyond the cardiomyocyte-centric view and highlight the ability of tissue-engineered hiPSC models to elucidate cell type-specific aspects of cardiac disease.

abstract: Liver organoids have been increasingly adopted as a critical in vitro model to study liver development and diseases. However, the pre-vascularization of liver organoids without affecting liver parenchymal specification remains a long-lasting challenge, which is essential for their application in regenerative medicine. Here, the large-scale formation of pre-vascularized human hepatobiliary organoids (vhHBOs) is presented without affecting liver epithelial specification via a novel strategy, namely nonparenchymal cell grafting (NCG). Endothelial and mesenchymal cells are grafted to human hepatobiliary organoids (hHBOs) at the different liver epithelial differentiation stages without supplementing with nonparenchymal culture medium and growth factors. Endothelial grafting at the stage of hepatic maturation offers an optimal integration efficiency compared to the stage of hepatic specification. Additionally, grafting with mesenchymal proves crucial in endothelial invading and sprouting into the liver epithelial cells during the establishment of vhHBOs. Ectopic liver implants into mice further displayed integration of vhHBOs into mice vascular networks. Notably, transplanted vhHBOs self-organized into native liver tissue like hepatic zone and bile ducts, indicating their potential to regenerate damaged hepatic and bile duct tissues. It is believed that nonparenchymal cell grafting will offer a novel technical route to form a high-fidelity complex in vitro model for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

abstract: Background: Glioblastoma IDH wild type (GBM IDH wt) has a poor prognosis and a strongly associated with inflammatory processes. Inflammatory molecules generate positive feedback with tumor cells fueling tumor growth as well as recruitment of immune cells that promote aggressiveness. Although the role of many inflammatory molecules is well known, there are many macromolecules, such as the S100A proteins, whose role is only now beginning to be established. Methods: Using RNA-seq, bioinformatics tools and a cohort of glioma patients to validate the results, we have analysed the inflammatory processes involved in glioma. Transcriptional profiles were also used to define biological processes of relevance to specific S100A proteins. Finally, we characterized the relevant immune populations with an IHC analysis and transcriptional profiling. Results: We have noted an increased expression of S100A in GBM IDH wt compared to gliomas IDH mutants. This allowed us to analyse the involvement of different members of the family, such as S100A9, A11 and A13 as possible regulators of inflammatory processes in the GBM-IDH wt microenvironment. Thus, we observed that S100A9 is located in hypoxic areas linked to the function of neutrophils, S100A11 is found in vascular areas associated with the function of perivascular pericytes and macrophages, and finally, S100A13 which is related to the dysfunction of microglia. Conclusion: Our findings define different functions for S100A9, A11 and A13 proteins that are associated with the architecture of the glioblastoma microenvironment and define its progression. Moreover, these alterations can be reversed by the RAGE inhibitor, Azeliragon which is in a phase I/II clinical trial NCT05635734.

abstract: Rationale: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant in colorectal cancer (CRC), correlating with immunosuppression and disease progression. Activation of the stimulator of interferon gene (STING) signaling pathway in TAMs offers a promising approach for CRC therapy. However, current STING agonists face challenges related to tumor specificity and administration routes. Method: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database analysis and multicolor immunofluorescence experiments of human CRC samples analysed triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) expression in the tumor microenvironment of CRC patients. We designed and synthesized a STING agonist prodrug GB2 to reprogram TAMs by targeting TREM2 in tumors. Preliminary evaluation of the anti-tumor capacity of prodrug GB2 in the mouse CRC model intravenously. RNA-seq analysis of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) after GB2 treatment reveals novel pharmacological mechanisms for the prodrug GB2. Results: Over-expressed TREM2 in TAMs correlates with CRC progression. Via targeting TREM2 expressed in TAMs, GB2 induces comprehensive tumor regression by administrating intravenously in mouse colon cancer models, as well as in a STINGlow mouse melanoma model, with no systemic toxicity. Upon treatment with GB2, TAMs exhibit an M1 phenotype with pro-inflammatory function and demonstrate enhanced phagocytosis capacity. The molecular mechanisms involve (1) GB2 upregulating the Glycolysis-ROS-HIF-1α axis, thereby promoting glucose metabolism and inflammatory cytokine expression; (2) GB2 inducing endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact (MERC), leading to mitochondrial fission, ultimately facilitating Ca2+-mediated phagocytosis. Besides, GB2-treated macrophages reverse immunosuppression, facilitating CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration and effector function. Combining GB2 with αPD-1 therapy reveals a synergistic effect on tumor inhibition, leading to prolonged mouse survival. Conclusion: By targeting TREM2 and activating the STING signaling pathway in TAMs, prodrug GB2 exhibits excellent anti-tumor efficacy and immune-activating capacity in the mouse colon cancer model.

abstract: Some individuals, even when heavily exposed to an infectious tuberculosis patient, do not develop a specific T-cell response as measured by interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). This could be explained by an IFN-γ-independent adaptive immune response, or an effective innate host response clearing Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) without adaptive immunity. In heavily exposed Indonesian tuberculosis household contacts (n = 1347), a persistently IGRA negative status was associated with presence of a BCG scar, and - especially among those with a BCG scar - with altered innate immune cells dynamics, higher heterologous (Escherichia coli-induced) proinflammatory cytokine production, and higher inflammatory proteins in the IGRA mitogen tube. Neither circulating concentrations of Mtb-specific antibodies nor functional antibody activity associated with IGRA status at baseline or follow-up. In a cohort of adults in a low tuberculosis incidence setting, BCG vaccination induced heterologous innate cytokine production, but only marginally affected Mtb-specific antibody profiles. Our findings suggest that a more efficient host innate immune response, rather than a humoral response, mediates early clearance of Mtb. The protective effect of BCG vaccination against Mtb infection may be linked to innate immune priming, also termed 'trained immunity'.

      Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, patients with multiple myeloma (MM) rarely respond to ICB. Accumulating evidence indicates that the complicated tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly impacts the efficacy of ICB therapy. Therefore, investigating how TME components in MM influence ICB treatment is urgent.

abstract: Epigenetic regulation profoundly influences the fate of cancer cells and their capacity to switch between lineages by modulating essential gene expression, thereby shaping tumor heterogeneity and therapy response. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the intricacies behind androgen receptor (AR)-independent lineage plasticity remain unclear, leading to a scarcity of effective clinical treatments. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing on both human and mouse prostate cancer samples, combined with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and multiple genetically engineered mouse models, we investigated the molecular mechanism of AR-independent lineage plasticity and uncovered a potential therapeutic strategy. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of human prostate cancers, both pre- and post-androgen deprivation therapy, revealed an association between liver kinase B1 (LKB1) pathway inactivation and AR independence. LKB1 inactivation led to AR-independent lineage plasticity and global DNA hypomethylation during prostate cancer progression. Importantly, the pharmacological inhibition of TET enzymes and supplementation with S-adenosyl methionine were found to effectively suppress AR-independent prostate cancer growth. These insights shed light on the mechanism driving AR-independent lineage plasticity and propose a potential therapeutic strategy by targeting DNA hypomethylation in AR-independent CRPC.

abstract: Aging remains the foremost risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, surpassing traditional factors in epidemiological significance. This review elucidates the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying vascular aging, with an emphasis on sex differences that influence disease progression and clinical outcomes in older adults. We discuss the convergence of aging processes at the macro- and microvascular levels and their contributions to the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. Critical analysis of both preclinical and clinical studies reveals significant sex-specific variations in these mechanisms, which could be pivotal in understanding the disparity in disease morbidity and mortality between sexes. The review highlights key molecular pathways, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and autophagy, and their differential roles in the vascular aging of males and females. We argue that recognizing these sex-specific differences is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing and managing age-related vascular pathologies. The implications for personalized medicine and potential areas for future research are also explored, emphasizing the need for a nuanced approach to the study and treatment of vascular aging.

abstract: A slew of common metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and steatohepatitis, are exponentially increasing in our sedentary and overfed society. While macronutrients directly impact metabolism and bioenergetics, new evidence implicates immune cells as critical sensors of nutritional cues and important regulators of metabolic homeostasis. A deeper interrogation of the intricate and multipartite interactions between dietary components, immune cells and metabolically active tissues is needed for a better understanding of metabolic regulation and development of new treatments for common metabolic diseases. Responding to macronutrients and micronutrients, immune cells play pivotal roles in interorgan communication between the microbiota, small intestine, metabolically active cells including hepatocytes and adipocytes, and the brain, which controls feeding behavior and energy expenditure. This Review focuses on the response of myeloid cells and innate lymphocytes to dietary cues, their cross-regulatory interactions and roles in normal and aberrant metabolic control.

abstract: Rampant phospholipid peroxidation initiated by iron causes ferroptosis unless this is restrained by cellular defences. Ferroptosis is increasingly implicated in a host of diseases, and unlike other cell death programs the physiological initiation of ferroptosis is conceived to occur not by an endogenous executioner, but by the withdrawal of cellular guardians that otherwise constantly oppose ferroptosis induction. Here, we profile key ferroptotic defence strategies including iron regulation, phospholipid modulation and enzymes and metabolite systems: glutathione reductase (GR), Ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), NAD(P)H Quinone Dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), retinal reductases and retinal dehydrogenases (RDH) and thioredoxin reductases (TR). A common thread uniting all key enzymes and metabolites that combat lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis is a dependence on a key cellular reductant, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). We will outline how cells control central carbon metabolism to produce NADPH and necessary precursors to defend against ferroptosis. Subsequently we will discuss evidence for ferroptosis and NADPH dysregulation in different disease contexts including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, cancer and neurodegeneration. Finally, we discuss several anti-ferroptosis therapeutic strategies spanning the use of radical trapping agents, iron modulation and glutathione dependent redox support and highlight the current landscape of clinical trials focusing on ferroptosis.

abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using 18F-labeled fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI) PET/CT in assessing the fibrotic remodeling of the pulmonary artery (PA) and the right ventricle (RV) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Methods: In a rat model of monocrotaline-induced PAH, rats were euthanized at different time points for tissue analysis (fibroblast activation protein immunofluorescence and Masson's trichrome staining) after completing 18F-FAPI PET/CT and hemodynamic measurements. Thirty-eight PAH patients were enrolled to participate in 18F-FAPI PET/CT imaging, with right heart catheterization and echocardiography performed within 1 wk to assess pulmonary hemodynamics and cardiac function. Results: In the animal experiments, RV systolic pressure in monocrotaline rats increased from day 14 to day 21 after injection. 18F-FAPI uptake and fibroblast activation protein expression in the myocardium and lungs peaked on day 14 after injection. Collagen deposition in the RVs and peripheral PAs of monocrotaline rats progressively deteriorated from day 14 to day 21. In the human PAH study, 18F-FAPI PET/CT imaging identified varying degrees of 18F-FAPI uptake in the myocardium and proximal and distal PAs, correlating with clinical, RV function, and pulmonary hemodynamic parameters. Among the 5 follow-up patients who underwent a second 18F-FAPI PET/CT scan after 6 mo (range, 4-9 mo) of PAH-targeted therapy, 3 demonstrated reduced 18F-FAPI uptake, corresponding with clinical improvement. Conclusion: 18F-FAPI PET/CT imaging is feasible for visualizing the remodeling of the PA and the RV in PAH. Although it offers promise for assessing disease-related changes, its role in evaluating disease severity and monitoring therapeutic efficacy requires further investigation.

abstract: In organisms ranging from vertebrates to plants, major components of centromeres are rapidly evolving repeat sequences, such as tandem repeats (TRs) and transposable elements (TEs), which harbour centromere-specific histone H3 (CENH3)1,2. Complete centromere structures recently determined in human and Arabidopsis suggest frequent integration and purging of retrotransposons within the TR regions of centromeres3-5. Despite the high impact of 'centrophilic' retrotransposons on the paradox of rapid centromere evolution, the mechanisms involved in centromere targeting remain poorly understood in any organism. Here we show that both Ty3 and Ty1 long terminal repeat retrotransposons rapidly turnover within the centromeric TRs of Arabidopsis species. We demonstrate that the Ty1/Copia element Tal1 (Transposon of Arabidopsis lyrata 1) integrates de novo into regions occupied by CENH3 in Arabidopsis thaliana, and that ectopic expansion of the CENH3 region results in spread of Tal1 integration regions. The integration spectra of chimeric TEs reveal the key structural variations responsible for contrasting chromatin-targeting specificities to centromeres versus gene-rich regions, which have recurrently converted during the evolution of these TEs. Our findings show the impact of centromeric chromatin on TE-mediated rapid centromere evolution, with relevance across eukaryotic genomes.

publication_date: 2024 Dec 30:S0092-8674(24)01346-1.
abstract: The detection of molecular patterns associated with invading pathogens is a hallmark of innate immune systems. Prokaryotes deploy sophisticated host defense mechanisms in innate anti-phage immunity. Shedu is a single-component defense system comprising a putative nuclease SduA. Here, we report cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of apo- and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-bound tetrameric SduA assemblies, revealing that the N-terminal domains of SduA form a clamp that recognizes free DNA ends. End binding positions the DNA over the PD-(D/E)XK nuclease domain, resulting in dsDNA nicking at a fixed distance from the 5' end. The end-directed DNA nicking activity of Shedu prevents propagation of linear DNA in vivo. Finally, we show that phages escape Shedu immunity by suppressing their recombination-dependent DNA replication pathway. Taken together, these results define the antiviral mechanism of Shedu systems, underlining the paradigm that recognition of pathogen-specific nucleic acid structures is a conserved feature of innate immunity across all domains of life.

abstract: Mutations in the ANXA11 gene, encoding an RNA-binding protein, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the underlying in vivo mechanisms remain unclear. This study examines the clinical features of ALS patients harboring the ANXA11 hotspot mutation p.P36R, characterized by late-onset motor neuron disease and occasional multi-system involvement. To elucidate the pathogenesis, we developed a knock-in mouse model carrying the p.P36R mutation. In both heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice, ANXA11 protein levels were comparable to those in wild-type. Both groups exhibited late-onset motor dysfunction at approximately 10 months of age, with similar survival rates to wild-type (> 24 months) and no signs of dementia. Pathological analysis revealed early abnormal aggregates in spinal cord motor neurons, cortical neurons, and muscle cells of homozygous mice. From 2 months of age, we observed mislocalized ANXA11 aggregates, SQSTM1/p62-positive inclusions, and cytoplasmic TDP-43 mislocalization, which intensified with disease progression. Importantly, mutant ANXA11 co-aggregated with TDP-43 and SQSTM1/p62-positive inclusions. Electron microscopy of the gastrocnemius muscle uncovered myofibrillar abnormalities, including sarcomeric disorganization, Z-disc dissolution, and subsarcolemmal electron-dense structures within autophagic vacuoles. Autophagic flux, initially intact at 2 months, was impaired by 9 months, as evidenced by decreased Beclin-1 and LC3BII/I levels and increased SQSTM1/p62 expression, coinciding with mTORC1 hyperactivation. Significant motor neuron loss and neuroinflammation were detected by 9 months, with marked muscle dystrophy apparent by 12 months compared to wild-type controls. These findings implicate the gain-of-function ANXA11 mutation drives late-onset motor neuron disease by early presymptomatic proteinopathy, progressive neuronal degeneration, neuroinflammation, and autophagic dysfunction.

abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has advanced our understanding of cell types and their heterogeneity within the human liver, but the spatial organization at single-cell resolution has not yet been described. Here we apply multiplexed error robust fluorescent in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to map the zonal distribution of hepatocytes, spatially resolve subsets of macrophage and mesenchymal populations, and investigate the relationship between hepatocyte ploidy and gene expression within the healthy human liver. Integrating spatial information from MERFISH with the more complete transcriptome produced by single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), also reveals zonally enriched receptor-ligand interactions. Finally, MERFISH and snRNA-seq analysis of fibrotic liver samples identify two hepatocyte populations that expand with injury and do not have clear zonal distributions. Together these spatial maps of the healthy and fibrotic liver provide a deeper understanding of the cellular and spatial remodeling that drives disease which, in turn, could provide new avenues for intervention and further study.

abstract: Circadian neurons within animal brains orchestrate myriad physiological processes and behaviors, but the contribution of these neurons to the regulation of sleep is not well understood. To address this deficiency, we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing to generate a comprehensive census of transcriptomic cell types of Drosophila clock neurons. We focused principally on the enigmatic DN3s, which constitute most fly brain clock neurons and were previously almost completely uncharacterized. These DN3s are organized into 12 clusters with unusual gene expression features compared to the more well-studied clock neurons. We further show that previously uncharacterized DN3 subtypes promote sleep through a G protein-coupled receptor, TrissinR. Our findings indicate an intricate regulation of sleep behavior by clock neurons and highlight their remarkable diversity in gene expression and functional properties.

abstract: T helper 17 (Th17) cells are effector cells that mediate inflammatory responses to bacterial and fungal pathogens. While the cytokine signaling inputs required to generate Th17s are established, less is known about intracellular pathways that drive Th17 differentiation. Our previously published phosphoproteomic screen identifies that PIKFYVE, a lipid kinase that generates the phosphatidylinositol PtdIns(3,5)P2, is activated during Th17 differentiation. Herein, we discovered that PIKFYVE regulates kinase and transcription factor networks to promote Th17 differentiation. As a specific example, PtdIns(3,5)P2 directly stimulates mTORC1 kinase activity to promote cell division and differentiation pathways. Furthermore, PIKFYVE promotes STAT3 phosphorylation, which is required for Th17 differentiation. Chemical inhibition or CD4-specific deletion of PIKFYVE reduces Th17 differentiation and autoimmune pathology in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis murine model of multiple sclerosis. Our findings identify molecular mechanisms by which PIKFYVE promotes Th17 differentiation and suggest that PIKFYVE is a potential therapeutic target in Th17-driven autoimmune diseases.

      Autonomic regulation has been identified as a potential regulator of pain via vagal nerve mediation, assessed through heart rate variability (HRV). Non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) and heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB) have been proposed to modulate pain. A limited number of studies compare nVNS and HRVB in persons with chronic pain conditions. This systematic review compared interventions of nVNS and HRVB in adults with long-standing pain conditions.

abstract: Oxidative stress is present in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, the effect of increased dietary antioxidants on reducing COPD risk remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the Composite Dietary Antioxidant Index (CDAI) with COPD in adults. This study conducted a cross-sectional investigation using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning from 2015 to March 2020 to explore the association between CDAI and COPD in adults. This study included 9295 participants. Three logistic regression models (crude model, partially adjusted model, and fully adjusted model) and restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves were utilized to assess the association between CDAI levels and COPD risk. Subsequently, a two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) was employed to analyze the causal impact of antioxidant levels within CDAI on the occurrence of COPD. CDAI levels were inversely associated with COPD after adjusting for confounders (OR=0.97, 95%CI:0.95-1.00), and the association was linear (p<0.001), and the results of the RCS showed that CDAI was linearly correlated with COPD occurrence (p<0.001). MR analysis revealed a causal relationship between vitamin C and COPD occurrence (OR=0.99, 95%CI:0.98-1.00, p<0.05). Our study indicates that dietary sources of antioxidants may reduce the risk of COPD occurrence, and the results of the MR analysis further show that vitamin C is causally associated with a reduced risk of COPD occurrence. However, further exploration is needed to understand how antioxidants prevent COPD.

abstract: Sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) has been identified as an entry receptor for hepatitis B virus (HBV), but the molecular events of the viral post-endocytosis steps remain obscure. In this study, we discovered that manganese (Mn) could strongly inhibit HBV infection in NTCP-reconstituted HepG2 cells without affecting viral replication. We therefore profiled the antiviral effects of Mn2+ in an attempt to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms involved in early HBV infection. Intriguingly, Mn2+ conspicuously stimulated lysosomal activity, as evidenced by hyperactivation of mTORC1 and increased endo/lysosomal acidity. After HBV-triggered internalization, the NTCP receptor was sorted to late endosomal compartments by the ESCRT machinery in concert with the invading virion. The establishment of HBV infection was found to be independent of lysosomal fusion-driven late endosome maturation; Mn2+-induced lysosomal hyperfunction virtually impaired infection, suggesting that virions may gain cytosolic access directly from late endosomes. In contrast, suppression of lysosomal activity substantially enhanced HBV infection. Prolonged mTORC1 inactivation facilitated viral infection by depleting lysosomes and accelerating endocytic transport of virions. Notably, treatment with the natural steroidal alkaloid tomatidine recapitulated the effects of Mn2+ in stimulating lysosomal activity and exhibited potent anti-HBV activity in HepG2-NTCP cells and in proliferating human hepatocyte organoids. These findings provide new insights into the post-endocytosis events of HBV infection. The negative regulation of early HBV infection by endo/lysosomal activity makes it a promising target for antiviral therapies.

abstract: Bone marrow adipose tissue is a distinct adipose subtype comprising more than 10% of fat mass in healthy humans. However, the functions and pathophysiological correlates of this tissue are unclear, and its genetic determinants remain unknown. Here, we use deep learning to measure bone marrow adiposity in the femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and spine from MRI scans of approximately 47,000 UK Biobank participants, including over 41,000 white and over 6300 non-white participants. We then establish the heritability and genome-wide significant associations for bone marrow adiposity at each site. Our meta-GWAS in the white population finds 67, 147, 134, and 174 independent significant single nucleotide polymorphisms, which map to 54, 90, 43, and 100 genes for the femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and spine, respectively. Transcriptome-wide association studies, colocalization analyses, and sex-stratified meta-GWASes in the white participants further resolve functional and sex-specific genes associated with bone marrow adiposity at each site. Finally, we perform a multi-ancestry meta-GWAS to identify genes associated with bone marrow adiposity across the different bone regions and across ancestry groups. Our findings provide insights into BMAT formation and function and provide a basis to study the impact of BMAT on human health and disease.

abstract: A common digestive system cancer with a dismal prognosis and a high death rate globally is breast cancer (BRCA). BRCA recurrence, metastasis, and medication resistance are all significantly impacted by cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, the relationship between CSCs and the tumor microenvironment in BRCA individuals remains unknown, and this information is critically needed. Our research utilized bioinformatics techniques and TCGA data to explore the complex relationship between CSCs and BRCA development. We identified 26 stem cell gene sets from the Stem Checker database and classified BRCA samples into stemness subtypes using consensus clustering. Prognosis, tumor microenvironment (TME) elements, and treatment responses varied across subtypes. Using LASSO, Cox regression, and differential expression analysis, we developed a stemness-risk model. BRCA patients were divided into two groups (Cluster A and Cluster B). Cluster B exhibited an improved prognosis, higher PIK3CA mutation frequency, and increased levels of CD8 T cells and regulatory Tregs. A 5-gene stemness model was constructed, showing that higher stemness scores correlated with poorer prognosis. The model was validated using the METABRIC cohort data from cBioPortal. Our findings identify two stemness-related subgroups with distinct prognoses and TME patterns. Further experimental validation is necessary before this model can be considered for clinical application.

abstract: Alpha-synuclein (αS) aggregation is a widely regarded hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and can be detected through synuclein amplification assays (SAA). This study investigated the association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) radiological measures in 41 PD patients (14 iPD, 14 GBA1-PD, 13 LRRK2-PD) and 14 age-and-sex-matched healthy controls. Quantitative measures including striatal binding ratios (SBR), whole-brain and deep gray matter volumes, neuromelanin-MRI (NM-MRI), functional connectivity (FC), and white matter (WM) diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) were calculated. Nine LRRK2-PD patients were SAA-negative (PD-SAA-). PD-SAA+ patients showed lower whole-brain gray matter, putamenal, brainstem, and substantia nigra volumes, reduced FC in the left caudate, and lower fractional anisotropy in the left fronto-occipital fasciculus compared to PD-SAA-. Taken together, αS aggregation was observed in iPD, GBA1-PD, and 38% of LRRK2-PD patients, and this was associated with reduced regional brain volumes, altered caudal FC, and SBRs. These changes were less pronounced in PD-SAA-, possibly suggesting a milder neurodegenerative process.

abstract: Immunometabolism is critical in the regulation of immunity and inflammation; however, the mechanism of preventing aberrant activation-induced immunopathology remains largely unclear. Here, we report that glyoxalase II (GLO2) in the glycolysis branching pathway is specifically downregulated by NF-κB signaling during innate immune activation via tristetraprolin (TTP)-mediated mRNA decay. As a result, its substrate S-D-lactoylglutathione (SLG) accumulates in the cytosol and directly induces D-lactyllysine modification of proteins. This nonenzymatic lactylation by SLG is greatly facilitated by a nearby cysteine residue, as it initially reacts with SLG to form a reversible S-lactylated thiol intermediate, followed by SN-transfer of the lactyl moiety to a proximal lysine. Lactylome profiling identifies 2255 lactylation sites mostly in cytosolic proteins of activated macrophages, and global protein structure analysis suggests that proximity to a cysteine residue determines the susceptibility of lysine to SLG-mediated D-lactylation. Furthermore, lactylation is preferentially enriched in proteins involved in immune activation and inflammatory pathways, and D-lactylation at lysine 310 (K310) of RelA attenuates inflammatory signaling and NF-κB transcriptional activity to restore immune homeostasis. Accordingly, TTP-binding site mutation or overexpression of GLO2 in vivo blocks this feedback lactylation in innate immune cells and promotes inflammation, whereas genetic deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of GLO2 restricts immune activation and attenuates inflammatory immunopathology both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, dysregulation of the GLO2/SLG/D-lactylation regulatory axis is closely associated with human inflammatory phenotypes. Overall, our findings uncover an immunometabolic feedback loop of SLG-induced nonenzymatic D-lactylation and implicate GLO2 as a promising target for combating clinical inflammatory disorders.

abstract: T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive cancer comprising diverse subtypes that are challenging to stratify using conventional immunophenotyping. To gain insights into subset-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities, we performed an integrative multiomics analysis of bone marrow samples from newly diagnosed T cell ALL, early T cell precursor ALL, and T/myeloid mixed phenotype acute leukemia. Leveraging cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes in conjunction with T cell receptor sequencing, we identified a subset of patient samples characterized by activation of inflammatory and stem gene programs. These inflammatory T-lineage samples exhibited distinct biological features compared with other T-lineage ALL samples, including the production of proinflammatory cytokines, prevalence of mutations affecting cytokine signaling and chromatin remodeling, an altered immune microenvironment, and poor treatment responses. Moreover, we found that, although inflammatory T-lineage ALL samples were less sensitive to dexamethasone, they exhibited unique sensitivity to a BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax. To facilitate classification of patients with T-lineage ALL, we developed a computational inflammatory gene signature scoring system, which stratified patients and was associated with disease prognosis in three additional patient cohorts. By identifying a high-risk T-lineage ALL subtype on the basis of an inflammatory score, our study provides a framework for targeted therapeutic approaches for these challenging-to-treat cancers.

abstract: Herbivore insects deploy salivary effectors to manipulate the defense of their host plants. However, it remains unclear whether small RNAs from insects function as effectors in regulating plant-insect interactions. Here, we report that a microRNA (miR29-b) found in the saliva of phloem-feeding whitefly (Bemisa tabaci) can transfer into the host plant phloem during feeding and fine-tune the defense response of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). The salivary gland-enriched BtmiR29-b was produced by BtDicer 1 and released into tobacco via salivary exosomes. Once inside the plant, BtmiR29-b hijacks tobacco Argonaute 1 to silence the defense gene Bcl-2-associated athanogene 4 (NtBAG4). In tobacco, NtBAG4 acts as the positive regulator of phytohormones (salicylic acid) SA and (jasmonic acid) JA, enhancing plant defense against whitefly attacks. Interestingly, we also found that miR29-b acts as a salivary effector in another Hemipteran insect, the aphid Myzus persicae, where it also inhibits tobacco resistance by degrading NtBAG4. Moreover, miR29-b is highly conserved not only in Hemiptera, but also across other insect orders such as Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Orthoptera, and Blattaria. Computational analysis suggests that miR29-b may target the evolutionarily conserved BAG4 gene in other plant species as well. We further provide evidence on BtmiR29-b mediated BAG4 cleavage and defense suppress in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Taken together, our work demonstrated an insect-conserved miR29-b effector fine-tuning plant SA/JA-mediated defense by cross-kingdom silencing of the host BAG4 gene. These findings provide new insight into the defense and counter-defense mechanisms between herbivores and their host plants.

abstract: Background: Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is a cellular reprogramming mechanism by which endothelial cells acquire a mesenchymal phenotype. Endothelial cell dysfunction is the initiating factor of atherosclerosis (AS). Increasing evidence suggests that EndMT contributes to the occurrence and progression of atherosclerotic lesions and plaque instability. However, the mechanisms leading to EndMT in atherosclerotic plaques' microenvironment are poorly understood. Methods: Single-cell sequencing data of atherosclerotic plaques in mice fed with high-fat diet for different time periods were analyzed. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that the expression of PIM1 in ox-LDL stimulated endothelial cells and in human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions. ApoE -/- C57 mice were injected recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 through tail vein to explore the role of PIM1 in atherosclerosis. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was used to verify the substrates of PIM1. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, Oil Red O staining, and Masson's trichrome staining were used to assess the size of atherosclerotic plaques, lipid content, and collagen fiber content, respectively. Results: PIM1 expression in endothelial cells increased with the progression of AS in vivo. Endothelial cell-specific PIM1 knockdown negatively regulated atherosclerosis progression and the EndMT process. Knockdown of PIM1 in endothelial cells in vitro attenuated ox-LDL-induced EndMT. This process was primarily due to the reduction of PIM1, which led to decreased phosphorylation of NDRG1 at Ser330, and subsequently, reduced NDRG1 nuclear translocation. Consequently, the interaction between NDRG1 and PTBP1 was affected, ultimately impacting the mRNA levels of Vimentin, ZEB1, Slug, Snail, N-Cadherin, TAGLN, and α-SMA. The small molecule Max-40279 could inhibit NDRG1 phosphorylation at Ser330 and suppress EndMT. Conclusion: Our findings revealed the PIM1/P-NDRG1(S330)/PTBP1/EndMT axis as a critical factor promoting AS progression and could generate new strategies to prevent AS.

abstract: Efficacy of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors for kidney stone prevention in nondiabetic patients is unknown. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, crossover phase 2 trial, 53 adults (≥18 and <75 years) with calcium (n = 28) or uric acid (UA; n = 25) kidney stones (at least one previous kidney stone event) without diabetes (HbA1c < 6.5%, no diabetes treatment) were randomized to once daily empagliflozin 25 mg followed by placebo or reverse (2 weeks per treatment). Randomization and analysis were performed separately for both stone types. Primary analyses were conducted in the per protocol set. Primary outcomes were urine relative supersaturation ratios (RSRs) for calcium oxalate (CaOx), calcium phosphate (CaP) and UA-validated surrogates for stone recurrence. Prespecified RSR reductions (≥15%) were met in both groups of stone formers. In patients with calcium stones, empagliflozin reduced RSR CaP (relative difference to placebo, -36%; 95% confidence interval, -48% to -21%; P < 0.001), but not RSRs CaOx and UA. In patients with UA stones, empagliflozin reduced RSR UA (-30%; 95% confidence interval, -44% to -12%; P = 0.002) but not RSRs CaOx and CaP. No serious or prespecified adverse events occurred. Thus, empagliflozin substantially reduced RSRs in nondiabetic adults with calcium and UA kidney stones. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04911660 .

abstract: Zinc is an essential micronutrient that regulates a wide range of physiological processes, most often through zinc binding to protein cysteine residues. Despite being critical for modulation of protein function, the cysteine sites in the majority of the human proteome that are subject to zinc binding remain undefined. Here, we develop ZnCPT, a deep and quantitative mapping of the zinc-binding cysteine proteome. We define 6,173 zinc-binding cysteines, uncovering protein families across major domains of biology that are subject to constitutive or inducible zinc binding. ZnCPT enables systematic discovery of zinc-regulated structural, enzymatic, and allosteric functional domains. On this basis, we identify 52 cancer genetic dependencies subject to zinc binding and nominate malignancies sensitive to zinc-induced cytotoxicity. We discover a mechanism of zinc regulation over glutathione reductase (GSR), which drives cell death in GSR-dependent lung cancers. We provide ZnCPT as a resource for understanding mechanisms of zinc regulation of protein function.

abstract: CD8+ T cell exhaustion (Tex) has been widely acknowledged in human cancer, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that reduced amino acid (aa) metabolism and mTOR inactivation are accountable for Tex in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC cells impede the T cell-intrinsic transcription of SLC7A5 and SLC38A1, disrupting aa transport and consequently leading to mTOR inactivation. Further, the ubiquitination of YAP1 protein is the basis for NSCLC-mediated transcriptional inhibition of aa transporters. Mechanistically, NSCLC cells transfer β-TrCP-containing exosomes into T cells, inducing YAP1 ubiquitination and Tex. Consequently, inhibiting cancer-associated β-TrCP effectively restores the anti-tumor immune response of CD8+ T cells and curtails tumor growth in NSCLC patient-derived organoids. Together, our findings highlight a β-TrCP-dependent mechanism in steering intrinsic metabolic adaptation and CD8+ Tex, emphasizing microenvironmental β-TrCP as an immune checkpoint for therapeutic exploration against human NSCLC.

abstract: The mammalian early embryo development requires translation of maternal mRNA inherited from the oocyte. While poly(A) tail length influences mRNA translation efficiency during the oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET), molecular mechanisms regulating maternal RNA poly(A) tail length are not fully understood. In this study, we identified MARTRE, a previously uncharacterized protein family (MARTRE1-MARTRE6), as regulators expressed during mouse OET that modulate poly(A) tail length. MARTRE inhibits deadenylation through the direct interaction with the deadenylase CCR4-NOT, and ectopic expression of Martre stabilized mRNA by attenuating poly(A) tail shortening. Deletion of the Martre gene locus results in shortened poly(A) tails and decreased translation efficiency of actively translated mRNAs in mouse zygotes, but does not affect maternal mRNA decay. MARTRE proteins thus fine-tune maternal mRNA translation by negatively regulating the deadenylating activity of CCR4-NOT. Moreover, Martre knockout embryos show delayed 2-cell stage progression and compromised preimplantation development. Together, our findings highlight protection of long poly(A) tails from active deadenylation as an important mechanism to coordinate translation of maternal mRNA.

abstract: Glutaminase (GLS), a crucial gene regulating glutaminolysis, has received much attention as it was found to regulate tumor metabolism and copper-induced cell death. However, its biological roles and mechanisms in human cancers remain obscure. Consequently, the integrated pan-cancer analyses and biological experiments were conducted to elucidate its oncological functions. We found GLS was differentially expressed in human cancers and upregulated GLS predicted poor survival, clinicopathological progression, and tumor heterogeneity. Single-cell analysis found GLS was closely related to various biological functions and pathways. Spatial transcriptomic analysis found GLS expression was mainly derived from tumor cells, which implies tumor cells may have a stronger ability to utilize glutamine than antitumor immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Meanwhile, we noticed GLS expression was strongly related to the infiltration of various immune cells and stromal cells, the expression of immunomodulatory genes, the activity of some conventional antitumor agents, and the therapeutic response of immunotherapy. Moreover, enrichment analyses suggested GLS was related to various metabolic reprogramming, innate and adaptive immunity suppression, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Finally, we observed GLS was highly expressed in our gastric cancer (GC) cohort. As an independent risk factor for GC prognosis, high-GLS was closely related to pathological progression. Inhibiting GLS expression in GC cells effectively prevented proliferation, migration, and invasion and triggered apoptosis. In conclusion, GLS is an underlying biomarker for oncological progression, prognosis, TME, antitumor drug sensitivity, and immunotherapy response. Targeting GLS can facilitate the implementation of individualized and combined treatment strategies.

abstract: The NS1 binding protein, known for interacting with the influenza A virus protein, is involved in RNA processing, cancer, and nerve cell growth regulation. However, its role in stress response independent of viral infections remains unclear. This study investigates NS1 binding protein's function in regulating stress granules during oxidative stress through interactions with GABARAP subfamily proteins. We find that NS1 binding protein localizes to stress granules, interacting with core components, GABARAP proteins, and p62, a protein involved in autophagy. In cells lacking NS1 binding protein, stress granule dynamics are altered, and p62 ubiquitination is increased, suggesting impaired stress granule degradation. Overexpression of NS1 binding protein reduces p62 ubiquitination. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patient-derived neurons, reduced NS1 binding protein and p62 disrupt stress granule morphology. These findings identify NS1 binding protein as a negative regulator of p62 ubiquitination and a facilitator of GABARAP recruitment to stress granules, implicating it in stress granule regulation and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathogenesis.

abstract: Roles of liver-specific genes (LSGs) in tumor initiation and progression are rarely explored in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we show that LSGs are generally downregulated in HCC tumor tissues compared to non-HCC liver tissues, and low-LSG HCCs show poor prognosis and the activated c-Myc pathway. Among the c-Myc- and patient prognosis-associated LSGs, PGRMC1 significantly blocks c-Myc-induced orthotopic HCC formation. The role of PGRMC1 depends on its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where PGRMC1 interacts with PERK through their ER luminal domains. This interaction in turn activates PERK in an ER stress-independent manner, which phosphorylates eIF2α and consequently inhibits c-Myc protein translation. In HCC patients, PGRMC1 level is significantly reduced in tumor tissues and negatively associated with the c-Myc signature. Patients with low-PGRMC1 in their tumors have poor prognosis. Collectively, deregulated LSGs in HCC are associated with the c-Myc pathway activation and PGRMC1 blocks c-Myc-induced hepatic carcinogenesis through promoting ER stress-independent PERK activation.

abstract: Unlike most species that use telomerase for telomere maintenance, many dipterans, including Drosophila, rely on three telomere-specific retrotransposons (TRs)-HeT-A, TART, and TAHRE-to form tandem repeats at chromosome ends. Although TR transcription is crucial in their life cycle, its regulation remains poorly understood. This study identifies the Mediator complex, E2F1-Dp, and Scalloped/dTEAD as key regulators of TR transcription. Reducing the activity of the Mediator or Sd/dTEAD increases TR expression and telomere length, while overexpressing E2F1-Dp or depleting Rbf1 stimulates TR transcription. The Mediator and Sd/dTEAD regulate this process through E2F1-Dp. CUT&RUN (Cleavage under targets and release using nuclease) analysis shows direct binding of CDK8, Dp, and Sd/dTEAD to telomeric repeats, with motif enrichment revealing E2F- and TEAD-binding sites. These findings uncover the Mediator complex's role in controlling TR transcription and telomere length through E2F1-Dp and Sd, coupling the transcriptional regulation of the TR life cycle with host cell-cycle machinery to protect chromosome ends in Drosophila.

abstract: The adoptive transfer of TCR-T cells specific to neoantigens preferentially exhibits potent cytotoxicity to tumor cells and has shown promising efficacy in various preclinical human cancers. In this study, we first identified a functional TCR, Tcr-1, which selectively recognized the SYT-SSX fusion neoantigen shared by most synovial sarcomas. Engineered T-cell expressing Tcr-1 (Tcr-T1) demonstrated HLA-A*2402-restricted, antigen-specific anti-tumoral efficacy against synovial sarcoma cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, to extend its application, we developed a cooperative therapeutic modality, in which exogenous SYT-SSX fusion neoantigen was loaded into stimuli-responsive nanoparticles (NPs) formed by mPEG-PVGLIG-PCL copolymers (Neo-AgNPs) for tumor targeting delivery. As expected, Neo-AgNPs were proven to have great tumor penetration and local release. In situ, the modification was able to direct engineered Tcr-T1 against other HLA-A*2402-positive malignant cancer cell lines with significant antigen-specific cytotoxicity despite their inherent mutation profiles. With these favorable data, our established cooperative therapeutic modality has great potential for further clinical investigation and provides new insight for future TCR-T cell therapy development.

abstract: Pancreatic cancer (PC) progresses rapidly, and gemcitabine-based chemotherapy has brought only limited efficacy. Identifying key drivers and therapeutic targets holds significant clinical value. In this study, through comprehensive analysis of multiple PC databases, this work identifies TRIM21 as a promising driver mediator. This work further performs loss- and gain-of-function assays for TRIM21, revealing that TRIM21 knockout inhibits tumor proliferation and gemcitabine resistance both in vitro and vivo. Lipidomics reveal that silencing TRIM21 reduce the arachidonic acid production, and inhibit ferroptosis. Mechanically, through proteomics, ubiquitomics, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, the key metabolic enzyme of arachidonic acid -EPHX1 is identified as a downstream substrate of TRIM21. TRIM21 interacts with EPHX1 through its SPRY domain and promotes ubiquitin-mediated degradation of EPHX1 via K33- and K48-linked ubiquitination at the K105 site. Given the targeting potential, this work screens Bezafibrate to block the interaction between TRIM21 and EPHX1 and validates its sensitizing effect. In summary, TRIM21 promotes tumour growth and gemcitabine resistance in PC by inhibiting EPHX1-mediated arachidonic acid metabolism. This provides a novel and promising target for clinical treatment of PC.

abstract: Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma (FLC) is a rare liver cancer characterized by a fusion oncokinase of the genes DNAJB1 and PRKACA, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA). A few FLC-like tumors have been reported showing other alterations involving PKA. To better understand FLC pathogenesis and the relationships among FLC, FLC-like, and other liver tumors, we performed a massive multi-omics analysis. RNA-seq data of 1412 liver tumors from FLC, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatoblastoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are analyzed, obtaining transcriptomic signatures unrestricted by experimental processing methods. These signatures reveal which dysregulations are unique to specific tumors and which are common to all liver cancers. Moreover, the transcriptomic FLC signature identifies a unifying phenotype for all FLC tumors regardless of how PKA was activated. We study this signature at multi-omics and single-cell levels in the first spatial transcriptomic characterization of FLC, identifying the contribution of tumor, normal, stromal, and infiltrating immune cells. Additionally, we study FLC metastases, finding small differences from the primary tumors.

abstract: Ferroptosis is characterized as an iron-dependent and lipophilic form of cell death. However, it remains unclear what role ferroptosis has in adipose tissue function and activity. Here, we find a lower ferroptotic signature in the adipose tissue of individuals and mice with obesity. We further find that activation of ferroptotic signaling by a non-lethal dose of ferroptosis agonists significantly reduces lipid accumulation in primary adipocytes and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Notably, adipocyte-specific overexpression of acyl-coenzyme A synthetase long-chain family member 4 (Acsl4) or deletion of ferritin heavy chain (Fth) protects mice from HFD-induced adipose expansion and metabolic disorders via activation of ferroptotic signaling. Mechanistically, we find that 5,15-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5,15-DiHETE) activates ferroptotic signaling, resulting in the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α), thereby derepressing a thermogenic program regulated by the c-Myc-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 beta (Pgc1β) pathway. Our findings suggest that activating ferroptosis signaling in adipose tissues might help to prevent and treat obesity and its related metabolic disorders.

abstract: The APLAR has published a set of recommendations on the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in 2021. The current consensus paper supplements and updates specifically the treatment of lupus nephritis (LN) according to two rounds of Delphi exercise from members of the APLAR SLE special interest group, invited nephrologists, histopathologists, and lupus nephritis patients. For initial treatment of LN, we recommend a combination of glucocorticoids (GCs) with cyclophosphamide (CYC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or the calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) as first-line options. An upfront combination of immunosuppressive drugs and the biological agents may be considered in patients at significant risk of disease progression and renal function deterioration. Switching or "add-on" among different immunosuppressive agents, including biological agents, may be considered for refractory disease. Subsequent/maintenance therapy of LN should continue for at least 3 years to reduce the risk of renal flares. Lower dose MMF and azathioprine are options, but MMF maintenance should follow induction by the same drug. Prednisolone or equivalent should be maintained at a dose of 5 mg/day or less. The APLAR consensus for the management of LN includes recommendations for adjunctive therapies, monitoring and treatment of LN-related co-morbidities, and renal replacement therapies. It is hoped that this consensus paper can provide an evidence-based and pragmatic approach to the management of LN, taking into account the evidence level of therapies in Asian patients, cost-effectiveness, and differences in health care resources and reimbursement policies in the Asia-Pacific region.

abstract: Computed tomography coronary angiography provides a non-invasive evaluation of coronary artery disease that includes phenotyping of atherosclerotic plaques and the surrounding perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). Image analysis techniques have been developed to quantify atherosclerotic plaque burden and morphology as well as the associated PVAT attenuation, and emerging radiomic approaches can add further contextual information. PVAT attenuation might provide a novel measure of vascular health that could be indicative of the pathogenetic processes implicated in atherosclerosis such as inflammation, fibrosis or increased vascularity. Bidirectional signalling between the coronary artery and adjacent PVAT has been hypothesized to contribute to coronary artery disease progression and provide a potential novel measure of the risk of future cardiovascular events. However, despite the development of more advanced radiomic and artificial intelligence-based algorithms, studies involving large datasets suggest that the measurement of PVAT attenuation contributes only modest additional predictive discrimination to standard cardiovascular risk scores. In this Review, we explore the pathobiology of coronary atherosclerotic plaques and PVAT, describe their phenotyping with computed tomography coronary angiography, and discuss potential future applications in clinical risk prediction and patient management.

publication_date: 2025 Jan 2.
abstract: The establishment of naive pluripotency is a continuous process starting with the generation of inner cell mass (ICM) that then differentiates into epiblast (EPI). Recent studies have revealed key transcription factors (TFs) for ICM formation, but which TFs initiate EPI specification remains unknown. Here, using a targeted rapid protein degradation system, we show that GABPA is not only a regulator of major ZGA, but also a master EPI specifier required for naive pluripotency establishment by regulating 47% of EPI genes during E3.5 to E4.5 transition. Chromatin binding dynamics analysis suggests that GABPA controls EPI formation at least partly by binding to the ICM gene promoters occupied by the pluripotency regulators TFAP2C and SOX2 at E3.5 to establish naive pluripotency at E4.5. Our study not only uncovers GABPA as a master pluripotency regulator, but also supports the notion that mammalian pluripotency establishment requires a dynamic and stepwise multi-TF regulatory network.

abstract: Arginine-rich dipeptide repeat proteins (R-DPRs) are highly toxic proteins found in patients with C9orf72-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD). R-DPRs can cause toxicity by disrupting the natural phase behavior of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Mitigating this abnormal phase behavior is, therefore, crucial to reduce R-DPR-induced toxicity. Here, we use FUS as a model RBP to investigate the mechanism of R-DPR-induced aberrant RBP phase transition. We find that this phase transition can be mitigated by Kapβ2. However, as a nuclear import receptor and phase modifier for PY-NLS-containing RBPs, the function of WT Kapβ2 could lead to undesired interaction with its native substrates when used as therapeutics for C9-ALS/FTD. To address this issue, it is crucial to devise effective strategies that allow Kapβ2 to selectively target its binding to the R-DPRs, instead of the RBPs. We show that NLS-binding deficient Kapβ2W460A:W730A can indeed selectively interact with R-DPRs in FUS assembly without affecting normal FUS phase separation. Importantly, Kapβ2W460A:W730A prevents enrichment of poly(GR) in stress granules and mitigates R-DPR neurotoxicity. Thus, NLS-binding deficient Kapβ2 may be implemented as a potential therapeutic for C9-ALS/FTD.

abstract: Critical illness is a complex condition that can have a devastating impact on health and quality of life. Nutritional support is a crucial component of critical care that aims to maintain or restore nutritional status and muscle function. A one-size-fits-all approach to the components of nutritional support has not proven beneficial. Recent randomized controlled trials challenge the conventional strategy and support the safety and potential benefits of below-usual calorie and protein intakes at the early, acute phase of critical illness. Further research is needed to define optimal nutritional support throughout the intensive care unit stay. Individualized nutritional strategies relying on risk assessment tools or biomarkers deserve further investigation in rigorously designed, large, multicenter, randomized, controlled trials. Importantly, although nutritional support is crucial, it might not be sufficient to enhance the recovery of critically ill patients. Thus, achieving the greatest efficacy may require individualized nutritional support combined with early, prolonged physical rehabilitation within a multimodal, holistic care program throughout the patient's recovery journey.

abstract: The relationship between hearing loss (HL) and Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. Using individual-level and summary-level data from the UK Biobank and the largest genome-wide association studies, we examined this link through observational, Mendelian randomization and genetic pleiotropy analyses. Among 158,229 participants, PD risk rose with HL severity especially in elder and males, and hearing aids significantly reduced PD risk in males. Although our results did not support a causal association, genetic correlation analysis suggested a localized genetic overlap (17q21.31). We identified 1545 SNPs and 63 genes with pleiotropic effects on HL and PD, including 79 novel SNPs across 6 loci, with 3 showing strong co-localization. These loci were enriched in key tissues like brain, heart, liver and pancreas, linked to the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase complex pathway, and targeted by drugs such as Warfarin and Phenprocoumon. Overall, this study reveals the risk association, genetic basis, and pleiotropic loci connecting HL and PD.

abstract: Nucleosome is the basic structural unit of the genome. During processes like DNA replication and gene transcription, the conformation of nucleosomes undergoes dynamic changes, including DNA unwrapping and rewrapping, as well as histone disassembly and assembly. However, the wrapping characteristics of nucleosomes across the entire genome, including region-specificity and their correlation with higher-order chromatin organization, remains to be studied. In this study, we investigate the wrapping length of DNA on nucleosomes across the whole genome using wrapping-seq. We discover that the chromatin of mouse ES cells forms Nucleosome Wrapping Domains (NRDs), which can also be observed in yeast and fly genomes. We find that the degree of nucleosome wrapping decreases after DNA replication and is promoted by transcription. Furthermore, we observe that nucleosome wrapping domains delineate Hi-C compartments and replication timing domains. In conclusion, we have unveiled a previously unrecognized domainization principle of the chromatin, encoded by nucleosome wrapping states.

abstract: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the fourth leading cause of end-stage renal disease, contributing substantially to patient morbidity, mortality, and healthcare system strain. Emerging research highlights a pivotal role of epigenetics in ADPKD's pathophysiology, where mechanisms like DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA regulation significantly impact disease onset and progression. These epigenetic factors influence gene expression and regulate key processes involved in cyst formation and expansion, fibrosis, and inflammatory infiltration, thus accelerating ADPKD progression. Consequently, exploring epigenetic regulatory mechanisms presents a valuable pathway for developing novel therapeutic strategies and diagnostic biomarkers aimed at slowing or preventing ADPKD progression. This review systematically examines existing studies on epigenetic alterations-including DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA regulation-in ADPKD patients, providing insights into gene expression changes and functions, and identifying potential drug targets for ADPKD treatment. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the fourth leading cause of end-stage renal disease, causing significant morbidity, increasing patient mortality, and weakening the healthcare system. Further study on ADPKD has revealed that epigenetics plays an important role in the pathophysiological process of ADPKD. Epigenetics has a significant impact on the formation and progression of ADPKD through a variety of processes including DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA. In addition to boosting cyst formation and proliferation, it induces cystic fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration, ultimately leading to a poor prognosis. This review summarizes the current understanding of the associated alterations in gene expression and function produced by epigenetic regulation in ADPKD, as well as potential treatment targets.

abstract: Systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare clonal plasma cell disorder characterized by the production of amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chains, which causes the formation and deposition of amyloid fibrils, leading to multi-organ dysfunction. Current treatment is directed at the underlying plasma cell clone to achieve a profound reduction in the monoclonal free light chain production. The standard-of-care first-line therapy is a combination of daratumumab, cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (D-VCd regimen), resulting in high rates of haematological and organ responses. However, AL amyloidosis remains incurable, and all patients inevitably relapse. Hence, novel treatment options are needed for patients with an inadequate response or relapsed/refractory disease. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a tumour necrosis factor (TNF receptor superfamily receptor overexpressed on plasma cells in multiple myeloma (MM) and AL amyloidosis. Recently, several novel anti-BCMA immunotherapies have been approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MM, including antibody-drug conjugate belantamab mafodotin, bispecific antibodies teclistamab and elranatamab and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies idecabtagene vicleucel and ciltacabtagene autoleucel. Despite lower expression than in MM, BCMA is also a promising target in AL amyloidosis. This review aims to provide up-to-date information on the efficacy and toxicity of anti-BCMA therapy in AL amyloidosis.

abstract: Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) precisely control spatiotemporal gene expression in cells. Using a spatially resolved single-cell atlas of gene expression with chromatin accessibility across ten soybean tissues, we identified 103 distinct cell types and 303,199 accessible chromatin regions (ACRs). Nearly 40% of the ACRs showed cell-type-specific patterns and were enriched for transcription factor (TF) motifs defining diverse cell identities. We identified de novo enriched TF motifs and explored the conservation of gene regulatory networks underpinning legume symbiotic nitrogen fixation. With comprehensive developmental trajectories for endosperm and embryo, we uncovered the functional transition of the three sub-cell types of endosperm, identified 13 sucrose transporters sharing the DNA binding with one finger 11 (DOF11) motif that were co-upregulated in late peripheral endosperm, and identified key embryo cell-type specification regulators during embryogenesis, including a homeobox TF that promotes cotyledon parenchyma identity. This resource provides a valuable foundation for analyzing gene regulatory programs in soybean cell types across tissues and life stages.

abstract: Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy has transformed treatment for several solid tumors, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, significant challenges remain, including systemic toxicity, acquired resistance, and the lack of reliable biomarkers for patient selection. To enhance the effectiveness of ADC therapies in SCLC, we focused on target selection in this study by investigating the expression of ADC targets - SEZ6, DLL3, CD276, and TACSTD2 - in cell lines and patient samples. SEZ6 expression was significantly elevated in various SCLC transcriptional subtypes, particularly ASCL1, and exhibited gender-specific differences, being lower in women. DLL3 was primarily observed in the ASCL1 subtype, while CD276 showed high expression in non-neuroendocrine subtypes. TACSTD2 levels were generally low and attenuated in lymph nodes and brain metastases compared to primary tumors. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding target expression patterns to optimize ADC therapy and advance precision medicine in SCLC treatment.

abstract: Thermogenic fat, including brown and beige fat, dissipates heat via thermogenesis and enhances energy expenditure. Thus, its activation represents a therapeutic strategy to combat obesity. Here, we demonstrate that levels of F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBXW7), an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, negatively correlate with thermogenic fat functionality. FBXW7 overexpression in fat suppresses energy expenditure and thermogenesis, thus aggravates obesity and metabolic dysfunctions in mice. Conversely, FBXW7 depletion in fat leads to brown fat expansion and browning of white fat, and protects mice from diet induced obesity, hepatic steatosis, and hyperlipidemia. Mechanistically, FBXW7 binds to S6K1 and promotes its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which in turn impacts glycolysis and brown preadipocyte proliferation via lactate. Besides, the beneficial metabolic effects of FBXW7 depletion in fat are attenuated by fat-specific knockdown of S6K1 in vivo. In summary, we provide evidence that adipose FBXW7 acts as a major regulator for thermogenic fat biology and energy homeostasis and serves as potential therapeutic target for obesity and metabolic diseases.

abstract: Sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) in mitochondria has nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent protein deacetylase activity. As such, SIRT3 is crucial in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Advanced proteomics and transcriptomics studies have revealed that SIRT3 expression becomes altered when the heart or brain is affected by external stimuli or disease, such as diabetic cardiomyopathy, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. More specifically, SIRT3 participates in the development of these disorders through its deacetylase activity and in combination with downstream signaling pathways. The paper reviews SIRT3's expression changes, roles, and mechanisms associated with the development of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, strategies targeting SIRT3 to treat or regulate cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease development are discussed.

abstract: In recent decades, immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) has revolutionized cancer treatment and given hope where other cancer therapies have failed. CAR-NK cells are NK cells that have been engineered ex vivo with a CAR on the cell membrane with high specificity for specific target antigens of tumor cells. The impressive results of several studies suggest that CAR-NK cell therapy has significant potential and successful performance in cancer treatment. Despite its effectiveness, CAR-NK cell therapy can have significant challenges when it comes to treating cancer. These challenges include tumor heterogeneity, antigen escape, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, limited tissue migration from blood, exhaustion of CAR-NK cells, and inhibition by immunosuppressive checkpoint molecule signaling, etc. In CAR-T cell therapy, the use of combined approaches has shown encouraging outcomes for tumor regression and improved cancer treatment compared to single therapies. Therefore, to overcome these significant challenges in CAR-NK cells, innovative combination therapies of CAR-NK cells with other conventional therapies (e.g., chemotherapy and radiotherapy) or other immunotherapies are needed to counteract the above challenges and thereby increase the activity of CAR-NK cells. This review comprehensively discusses various cancer treatment approaches in combination with CAR-NK cell therapy in the hope of providing valuable insights that may improve cancer treatment in the near future.

abstract: Gastric cancer is a malignant gastrointestinal disease characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. The occurrence and progression of gastric cancer are influenced by various factors, including the abnormal alternative splicing of key genes. Recently, RBM39 has emerged as a tumor biomarker that regulates alternative splicing in several types of cancer. However, the specific functions and key alternative splicing events modulated by RBM39 in gastric cancer are still unclear. In this work, bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and immunoblotting of patient tissue samples revealed that RBM39 was highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues and that its elevated expression significantly reduced overall patient survival. Cell-line-based and tumor xenograft experiments demonstrated that RBM39 knockdown attenuated the growth of gastric cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, through RNA-seq, minigene, and RT‒PCR, we discovered and further validated that RBM39 inhibited exon 3 skipping, thereby modulating the splicing of MRPL33. The long isoform MRPL33-L, which includes exon 3, but not the short isoform MRPL33-S, which lacks exon 3, significantly promoted the proliferation and colony formation of gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, we observed an increased percent-splice-in (PSI) of MRPL33 in gastric cancer tissues. Genetic manipulation and pharmacological treatment with the RBM39 degrader indisulam demonstrated that RBM39 regulated cell proliferation by influencing the splicing switch of MRPL33 in gastric cancer cells and a xenograft mouse model. Our findings indicate that RBM39 regulates the oncogenic splicing of MRPL33 and suggest that it may serve as a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer.

abstract: Ferroptosis, a unique form of iron-dependent cell death triggered by lipid peroxidation accumulation, holds great promise for cancer therapy. Despite the crucial role of GPX4 in regulating ferroptosis, our understanding of GPX4 protein regulation remains limited. Through FACS-based genome-wide CRISPR screening, we identified MALT1 as a regulator of GPX4 protein. Inhibition of MALT1 expression enhances GPX4 ubiquitination-mediated degradation by up-regulating the E3 ubiquitin ligase RC3H1. Using both rescue assays and functional genetic screening, we demonstrate that pharmacologically targeting MALT1 triggers ferroptosis in liver cancer cells. Moreover, we show that targeting MALT1 synergizes with sorafenib or regorafenib to induce ferroptosis across multiple cancer types. These findings elucidate the modulatory effects of the MALT1-RC3H1 axis on GPX4 stability, revealing a molecular mechanism that could be exploited to induce ferroptosis for cancer therapy.

abstract: Macrophages are myeloid cells that receive, integrate, and respond to tumoral cues. Tumors evolve and are shaped by macrophages, with tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-tumor sculpting capacities going beyond an increase in their cellular mass. Longitudinal and local heterogeneity of TAM states is now possible with the use of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. However, understanding TAM biology and its fundamental functional programs is still challenging, probably because of the lack of models that fully integrate TAM complexity. Here, we aim to review TAM diversity not only at the level of single-cell phenotypes but also by integrating complex physiological signals that determine their complexity and plasticity in tumors.

abstract: Sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Among the various types of end-organ damage associated with sepsis, hepatic injury is linked to significantly higher mortality rates compared to dysfunction in other organ systems. This study aimed to investigate potential biomarkers of hepatic injury in sepsis patients through a multi-center, case-control approach. We enrolled three matched cohorts: 37 sepsis patients with hepatic dysfunction (S-HD), 37 sepsis patients without hepatic dysfunction (S-CON), and 18 healthy controls (HC). We measured five proposed biomarkers of hepatic dysfunction-ARG1, MDH1, GSTα, 5-NT, and SDH-using multiplex immunoassays. These biomarkers were compared to traditional markers of hepatic dysfunction, including albumin, bilirubin, ALT, AST, and GGT, across the cohorts using both conventional statistical methods and machine learning techniques. The median age of participants was comparable across cohorts: S-HD (65.0 years, IQR 49.5-82.5), S-CON (65.0 years, IQR 48.0-81.5), and HC (62.5 years, IQR 53.0-65.0; P = 0.794). Patients with hepatic dysfunction (S-HD) exhibited higher illness severity scores compared to those without hepatic dysfunction (S-CON): MODS scores were median 7.0 (IQR 4.0-10.0) in S-HD versus median 4.0 (IQR 2.0-7.0) in S-CON (P = 0.005), and SOFA scores were median 7.0 (IQR 4.0-11.0) in S-HD versus median 3.0 (IQR 2.0-6.0) in S-CON (P < 0.001). Hemoglobin and platelet counts were lower, while creatinine levels were higher in S-HD compared to S-CON (P < 0.05). On ICU Day 1, bilirubin, ALT, AST, GGT, and INR were significantly elevated in S-HD relative to S-CON (P ≤ 0.001), and albumin levels were lower (P < 0.05). Additionally, ARG1, GSTα, 5-NT, and SDH were significantly higher in S-HD patients on ICU Day 1 compared to S-CON (P < 0.05). ARG1, MDH1, and SDH showed positive correlations with AST, ALT, and MODS (P < 0.01). From ICU Day 1 to Day 7, ARG1, GSTα, SDH, and AST levels significantly decreased in S-HD patients (P < 0.05), whereas MDH1 and 5-NT levels did not. Among the proposed biomarkers, GSTα and 5-NT did not correlate with traditional hepatic dysfunction markers but were significant in identifying S-HD patients (feature importance 0.131 and 0.097, respectively) in a random forest classification model. This comprehensive model demonstrated excellent performance in distinguishing sepsis patients with hepatic injury, with sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.94, NPV 0.94, PPV 0.94, and AUC 0.94. The biomarkers ARG1, MDH1, GSTα, 5-NT, and SDH show promise as novel indicators of hepatic dysfunction associated with sepsis. This study provides a foundational basis for subsequent research aimed at characterizing and clinically validating these markers. Future investigations should focus on integrating these potential biomarkers into routine laboratory assessments for sepsis and related hepatic injury.

abstract: To broaden our understanding of bradyarrhythmias and conduction disease, we performed common variant genome-wide association analyses in up to 1.3 million individuals and rare variant burden testing in 460,000 individuals for sinus node dysfunction (SND), distal conduction disease (DCD) and pacemaker (PM) implantation. We identified 13, 31 and 21 common variant loci for SND, DCD and PM, respectively. Four well-known loci (SCN5A/SCN10A, CCDC141, TBX20 and CAMK2D) were shared for SND and DCD, while others were more specific for SND or DCD. SND and DCD showed a moderate genetic correlation (rg = 0.63). Cardiomyocyte-expressed genes were enriched for contributions to DCD heritability. Rare-variant analyses implicated LMNA for all bradyarrhythmia phenotypes, SMAD6 and SCN5A for DCD and TTN, MYBPC3 and SCN5A for PM. These results show that variation in multiple genetic pathways (for example, ion channel function, cardiac developmental programs, sarcomeric structure and cellular homeostasis) appear critical to the development of bradyarrhythmias.

abstract: Metabolic enzymes perform moonlighting functions during tumor progression, including the modulation of chemoresistance. However, the underlying mechanisms of these functions remain elusive. Here, utilizing a metabolic clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 knockout library screen, we observe that the loss of glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM), a rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis, noticeably increases the sensitivity of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to platinum-based chemotherapy. Mechanistically, we unveil a noncanonical mechanism through which nuclear GCLM competitively interacts with NF-kappa-B (NF-κB)-repressing factor (NKRF), to promote NF-κB activity and facilitate chemoresistance. In response to platinum drug treatment, GCLM is phosphorylated by P38 MAPK at T17, resulting in its recognition by importin a5 and subsequent nuclear translocation. Furthermore, elevated expression of nuclear GCLM and phospho-GCLM correlate with an unfavorable prognosis and poor benefit from standard chemotherapy. Overall, our work highlights the essential nonmetabolic role and posttranslational regulatory mechanism of GCLM in enhancing NF-κB activity and subsequent chemoresistance.

abstract: Glucose deprivation, a hallmark of the tumor microenvironment, compels tumor cells to seek alternative energy sources for survival and growth. Here, we show that glucose deprivation upregulates the expression of mitochondrial-cytochrome c oxidase II (MT-CO2), a subunit essential for the respiratory chain complex IV, in facilitating glutaminolysis and sustaining tumor cell survival. Mechanistically, glucose deprivation activates Ras signaling to enhance MT-CO2 transcription and inhibits IGF2BP3, an RNA-binding protein, to stabilize MT-CO2 mRNA. Elevated MT-CO2 increases flavin adenosine dinucleotide (FAD) levels in activating lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) to epigenetically upregulate JUN transcription, consequently promoting glutaminase-1 (GLS1) and glutaminolysis for tumor cell survival. Furthermore, MT-CO2 is indispensable for oncogenic Ras-induced glutaminolysis and tumor growth, and elevated expression of MT-CO2 is associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. Together, these findings reveal a role for MT-CO2 in adapting to metabolic stress and highlight MT-CO2 as a putative therapeutic target for Ras-driven cancers.

abstract: The STAT3 pathway promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, invasion and metastasis in cancer. STAT3 upregulates the transcription of the key epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcription factor SNAIL in a DNA binding-independent manner. However, the mechanism by which STAT3 is recruited to the SNAIL promoter to upregulate its expression is still elusive. In our study, the lysine methylation binding protein L3MBTL3 is positively associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in female patients with breast cancer. L3MBTL3 also promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis in breast cancer. Mechanistic analysis reveals that L3MBTL3 interacts with STAT3 and recruits STAT3 to the SNAIL promoter to increase SNAIL transcription levels. The interaction between L3MBTL3 and STAT3 is required for SNAIL transcription upregulation and metastasis in breast cancer, while the methylated lysine binding activity of L3MBTL3 is not required for these functions. In conclusion, L3MBTL3 and STAT3 synergistically upregulate SNAIL expression to promote breast cancer metastasis.

abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), a chronic and common neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the dense part of the substantia nigra and abnormal aggregation of alpha-synuclein. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disease characterized by chronic insulin resistance and deficiency in insulin secretion. Extensive evidence has confirmed shared pathogenic mechanisms underlying PD and T2DM, such as oxidative stress caused by insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and disorders of energy metabolism. Conventional drugs for treating T2DM, such as metformin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, affect nerve repair. Even drugs for treating PD, such as levodopa, can affect insulin secretion. This review summarizes the relationship between PD and T2DM and related therapeutic drugs from the perspective of insulin signaling pathways in the brain.

abstract: Protein language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in predicting the effects of missense variants but DNA language models have not yet shown a competitive edge for complex genomes such as that of humans. This limitation is particularly evident when dealing with the vast complexity of noncoding regions that comprise approximately 98% of the human genome. To tackle this challenge, we introduce GPN-MSA (genomic pretrained network with multiple-sequence alignment), a framework that leverages whole-genome alignments across multiple species while taking only a few hours to train. Across several benchmarks on clinical databases (ClinVar, COSMIC and OMIM), experimental functional assays (deep mutational scanning and DepMap) and population genomic data (gnomAD), our model for the human genome achieves outstanding performance on deleteriousness prediction for both coding and noncoding variants. We provide precomputed scores for all ~9 billion possible single-nucleotide variants in the human genome. We anticipate that our advances in genome-wide variant effect prediction will enable more accurate rare disease diagnosis and improve rare variant burden testing.

abstract: Mosquito-borne flaviviruses represent a public health challenge due to the high-rate endemic infections, severe clinical outcomes, and the potential risk of emerging global outbreaks. Flavivirus disease pathogenesis converges on cellular factors from vectors and hosts, and their interactions are still unclear. Exosomes and microparticles are extracellular vesicles released from cells that mediate the intercellular communication necessary for maintaining homeostasis; however, they have been shown to be involved in disease establishment and progression. This review focuses on the roles of extracellular vesicles in the pathogenesis of mosquito-borne flavivirus diseases: how they contribute to viral cycle completion, cell-to-cell transmission, and cellular responses such as inflammation, immune suppression, and evasion, as well as their potential use as biomarkers or therapeutics (antiviral or vaccines). We highlight the current findings concerning the functionality of extracellular vesicles in different models of dengue virus, Zika virus, yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and West Nile virus infections and diseases. The available evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles mediate diverse functions between hosts, constituting novel effectors for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of flaviviral diseases.

abstract: Outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) proteins communicate with the cytosol and other organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum. This communication is important in thermogenic adipocytes to increase the energy expenditure that controls body temperature and weight. However, the regulatory mechanisms of OMM protein insertion are poorly understood. Here the stress-induced cytosolic chaperone PPID (peptidyl-prolyl isomerase D/cyclophilin 40/Cyp40) drives OMM insertion of the mitochondrial import receptor TOM70 that regulates body temperature and weight in obese mice, and respiratory/thermogenic function in brown adipocytes. PPID PPIase activity and C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeats, which show specificity towards TOM70 core and C-tail domains, facilitate OMM insertion. Our results provide an unprecedented role for endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-activated chaperones in controlling energy metabolism through a selective OMM protein insertion mechanism with implications in adaptation to cold temperatures and high-calorie diets.

abstract: Background: Kidney stone disease is a major risk factor for impaired renal function, leading to renal fibrosis and end-stage renal disease. High global prevalence and recurrence rate pose a significant threat to human health and healthcare resources. Investigating the mechanisms of kidney stone-induced injury is crucial. Materials and Methods: We examined the relationship between insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) at three levels: in patients with kidney stones, in mice induced with glyoxalate crystals, and in HK2 cells stimulated with calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and untargeted metabolomics were used to investigate IGF1R's biological mechanisms, followed by in vivo validation in mice. Results: IGF1R was elevated in the kidney stone model, which was significantly associated with EMT progression. RNA-seq analysis indicated that IGF1R enhances EMT through the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Further experiments at mRNA and protein levels confirmed the activation of this pathway regulated by IGF1R, promoting EMT. Additionally, untargeted metabolomics revealed that IGF1R drives the activation of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) in glycolysis, further facilitating EMT. In vivo experiments confirmed that IGF1R increases LDHA activity through the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, thereby enhancing the EMT. Conclusion: IGF1R promotes EMT in COM-induced kidney injury by activating LDHA via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling.

abstract: Chloride (Cl-) ions cause major damage to crops in saline soils. Understanding the key factors that influence Cl- uptake and translocation will aid the breeding of more salt-tolerant crops. Here, using genome-wide association study and transcriptomic analysis, we identified a NITRATE TRANSPORTER 1 (NRT1)/PEPTIDE TRANSPORTER family (NPF) protein, GmNPF7.5, as the dominant gene locus influencing Cl- homeostasis in soybean (Glycine max). A natural SNP variation resulted in two haplotypes (GmNPF7.5HapA and GmNPF7.5HapB), which was associated with Cl- content. GmNPF7.5HapA mediated Cl- or nitrate (NO3-) uptake in a pH-dependent manner and exhibited higher permeability for Cl- over NO3-. The suppression of GmNPF7.5HapA expression decreased Cl- accumulation and salt damage in plants, whereas its overexpression showed the opposite effects. The elite haplotype GmNPF7.5HapB diminished Cl- transport activity independently from NO3- permeability, thus enhancing soybean salt tolerance. Furthermore, the protein kinase GmPI4Kγ4 could phosphorylate GmNPF7.5, which repressed Cl- uptake without affecting NO3- permeability. Our findings define a regulatory mechanism for Cl- control under NaCl stress, providing a strategy for the improvement of salt tolerance in soybean plants.

abstract: Tumor suppressor BRCA2 executes homologous recombination to repair DNA double-strand breaks in collaboration with RAD51, involving exon 11 and 27. Exon 11 constitutes a region where pathogenic variants (PVs) accumulate, and mutations in this region are known to contribute to carcinogenesis. However, the impact of the heterozygous PVs of BRCA2 exon 11 on the life quality beyond cancer risk, including male fertility, remains unclear. Here, we established a rat model with a frameshift on the seventh BRC repeat in Brca2 exon 11 (Brca2+/p.T1942fs), which is homologous to human BRCA2+/p.T1974fs, using CRISPR/Cas9 system. Our analyses revealed that the heterozygous rats with the PV in the BRCA2 exon 11 showed increased DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis in spermatogonia and spermatocytes, accelerated testicular germ cell loss, and deterioration in sperm quality according with aging, ultimately resulting in early male reproductive dysfunction. Of note, these alterations in testes and sperm, including DNA fragmentation in spermatozoa, were observed from completion of sexual maturation. The present findings suggest that it is crucial to consider not only cancer risk but also potential declines in reproductive capacity in men carrying BRCA2 exon 11 PVs. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether similar traits appear in humans.

abstract: Metabolic flexibility in skeletal muscle is essential for maintaining healthy glucose and lipid metabolism, and its dysfunction is closely linked to metabolic diseases. Exercise enhances metabolic flexibility, making it an important tool for discovering mechanisms that promote metabolic health. Here we show that pantothenate kinase 4 (PanK4) is a new conserved exercise target with high abundance in muscle. Muscle-specific deletion of PanK4 impairs fatty acid oxidation which is related to higher intramuscular acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA levels. Elevated acetyl-CoA levels persist regardless of feeding state and are associated with whole-body glucose intolerance, reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in glycolytic muscle, and impaired glucose uptake during exercise. Conversely, increasing PanK4 levels in glycolytic muscle lowers acetyl-CoA and enhances glucose uptake. Our findings highlight PanK4 as an important regulator of acetyl-CoA levels, playing a key role in both muscle lipid and glucose metabolism.

abstract: The extracellular matrix is an essential component and constitutes a dynamic microenvironment of the vessel wall with an indispensable role in vascular homeostasis and disease. From early development through to ageing, the vascular extracellular matrix undergoes various biochemical and biomechanical alterations in response to diverse environmental cues and exerts precise regulatory control over vessel remodelling. Advances in novel technologies that enable the comprehensive evaluation of extracellular matrix components and cell-matrix interactions have led to the emergence of therapeutic strategies that specifically target this fine-tuned network. In this Review, we explore various aspects of extracellular matrix biology in vascular development, disorders and ageing, emphasizing the effect of the extracellular matrix on disease initiation and progression. Additionally, we provide an overview of the potential therapeutic implications of targeting the extracellular matrix microenvironment in vascular diseases.

abstract: This study (NCT04728035) aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of liposomal irinotecan (HE072) in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC). This study consisted of two parts. In part 1, the 3 + 3 design was used to investigate three dose levels of HE072 (50, 70 and 90 mg/m2). In part 2, patients were enrolled in two cohorts (mTNBC and HER2-negative breast cancer brain metastasis [BCBM]), and received HE072 70 mg/m2 every two weeks (Q2W). The primary endpoints were maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The secondary endpoints were pharmacokinetic profiles and efficacy including objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) (all patients) and Central Nervous System ORR and clinical benefit rate (CBR, for patients with HER2-negative BCBM), duration of response, progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS). A total of 119 patients were enrolled, including 101 mTNBC and 18 HER2-negative BCBM. One dose limiting toxicity (grade 3 nausea and vomiting) occurred at 70 mg/m2, and the MTD was not reached. The most common ≥ grade 3 TEAEs related to HE072 included neutropenia (21.0%), leukopenia (18.5%), diarrhea (10.1%). Among 87 evaluable patients with mTNBC, 22 patients (25.3%) achieved overall response. The DCR was 67.8% (59/87). The median PFS and OS were 4.8 months and 14.1 months, respectively. The RP2D was 70 mg/m2 Q2W. Promising antitumor activity in heavily pre-treated patients with mTNBC was observed, which warrants further validation.

abstract: Endurance exercise training (ET) is an effective treatment in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), but the efficacy of resistance training in this patient population has been only scarcely evaluated. In this multicenter, randomized trial, we evaluated the effects of combined endurance and resistance training over 12 months in patients with HFpEF. The primary endpoint was a modified Packer score, including all-cause mortality, hospitalizations classified as potentially related to heart failure or exercise and changes in peak oxygen consumption (   V ̇  O 2    ), diastolic function (E/e'), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and global self-assessment (GSA). In total, 322 patients (mean age, 70 years; 192 females (59.6%) and 130 males (40.4%)) were randomized (1:1) to ET or usual care (UC). At 12 months, the modified Packer score showed an improvement in 33 ET patients (20.5%) and in 13 UC patients (8.1%) and showed a worsening in 69 ET patients (42.9%) and in 71 UC patients (44.1%) (Kendall's tau-b = -0.073, P = 0.17). Although the primary endpoint was not met, clinically relevant differences favoring the ET group as compared to the UC group were observed for the following secondary endpoints: changes in peak   V ̇  O 2    (mean difference, 1.3 ml kg-1 min-1 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4-2.1)) and NYHA class (odds ratio = 7.77 (95% CI: 3.73-16.21)). No significant between-group differences were observed for other secondary endpoints, including change in E/e', change in GSA, time to cardiovascular hospitalization or all-cause mortality. In conclusion, 1 year of combined endurance and resistance ET did not result in a significantly better modified Packer score, but it did result in improvements in important clinical parameters, such as peak   V ̇  O 2    and NYHA class, as compared to UC.

abstract: In this review, we review the current status of biomarkers for aging and possible perspectives on anti-aging or rejuvenation from the standpoint of biomarkers. Aging is observed in all cells and organs, and we focused on research into senescence in the skin, musculoskeletal system, immune system, and cardiovascular system. Commonly used biomarkers include SA-βgal, cell-cycle markers, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and DNA-damage-related markers. In addition, each organ or cell has its specific markers. Generally speaking, a combination of biomarkers is required to define age-related changes. When considering the translation of basic research, biomarkers that are highly sensitive, highly specific, with validation and reliability as well as being non-invasive are optimal; however, currently reported markers do not fulfill the prerequisite for biomarkers. In addition, rodent models of aging do not necessarily represent human aging, and markers in rodent or cell models are not applicable in clinical settings. The prerequisite of clinically applicable biomarkers is that they provide useful information for clinical decision-making, such as predicting disease risk, diagnosing disease, monitoring disease progression, or guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, the development of non-invasive robust, reliable, and useful biomarkers in humans is necessary to develop anti-aging therapy for humans. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2025; ••: ••-••.

abstract: CDK4/6i, the first-line drug for treating ERα-positive breast cancer, significantly improves clinical outcomes. However, CDK4/6i resistance often develops and remains a major hurdle, and the underlying mechanisms remain challenging to fully investigate. Here, we used Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 library screening combined with single-cell sequencing to screen for molecules mediating CDK4/6i resistance and identified METTL14 as a determinant of CDK4/6i sensitivity. Clinical samples and datasets were analyzed and in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to confirm the critical function of METTL14 in CDK4/6i resistance. Mechanistically, METTL14 can induce an increase in E2F1 expression in breast cancer cells via an m6A IGF2BP2-dependent mechanism and thus promote CDK4/6i resistance. Furthermore, through a small molecule screen, a novel METTL14 inhibitor named WKYMVM, which can restore sensitivity to CDK4/6i in CDK4/6i-resistant breast cancer cells, was identified. Treatment with folate-conjugated liposomes targeting breast cancer cells that contained both a CDK4/6i and WKYMVM revealed the synergistic effect of METTL14 inhibition with CDK4/6i therapy in a CDK4/6i-resistant PDX model. Together, our findings reveal the mechanism of CDK4/6i resistance and provide a strategy for overcoming CDK4/6i resistance via METTL14 inhibition.

abstract: Observational studies have shown that the risk of developing herpes zoster (HZ) increases with the use of statins. However, there are many confounding factors in observational studies. Therefore, our Mendelian randomization (MR) study aimed to explore the causal role of lipids in HZ and to assess the causal impact of lipid-lowering drug targets on HZ risk. Our study used low-density lipoprotein (LDL) as a biomarker, and MR analysis was applied to study the effects of genetic inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR, targeted by statins), Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1, targeted by ezetimibe), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9, targeted by, e.g., alirocumab) on the risk of HZ. Second, we analyzed the overall effect of different lipid traits, including LDL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TGs), on the HZ. Finally, we analyzed the causal association between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and HZ. The primary MR analysis employed the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach, which MR supplemented‒Egger, weighted median and weighted mode methods. In addition, we performed sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the results and the presence of bias. Heterogeneity and pleiotropy analyses were performed to ensure the accuracy of the results. Genetically modified HMGCR inhibition was significantly associated with an increased risk of HZ (OR: 2.02, per standard deviation reduction in LDL; 95% CI 1.05-3.90; P = 0.035, P(BH) = 0.0525 < 0.1). Moreover, genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition was associated with a reduced risk of HZ (OR: 0.58, per standard deviation reduction in LDL; 95% CI 0.42-0.80; P = 0.001, P(BH) = 0.003 < 0.1). Sensitivity analysis did not provide statistical evidence of bias from pleiotropy or genetic confounding. No robust association was found for NPC1L1 inhibition. No significant effect of lipid traits or CVD on HZ risk was found. Our findings did not support dyslipidemia and CVD as causal factors for HZ. Among the three lipid-lowering drug targets, HMGCR inhibition (targeted by statins) was associated with an increased risk of HZ, and PCSK9 is a promising candidate drug target in HZ. These findings have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of HZ and for the development of new therapeutic strategies.

abstract: Resting natural killer (NK) cells display immediate effector functions after recognizing transformed or infected cells. The environmental nutrients and metabolic requirements to sustain these functions are not fully understood. Here, we show that NK cells rely on the use of extracellular pyruvate to support effector functions, signal transduction and cell viability. Glucose-derived carbons do not generate endogenous pyruvate. Consequently, NK cells import extracellular pyruvate that is reduced to lactate to regenerate glycolytic NAD+ and is oxidized in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to produce ATP. This supports serine production through phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, a pathway required for optimal proliferation following cytokine stimulation but dispensable for effector functions. In addition, like mouse NK cells, human NK cells rely on a citrate-malate configuration of the TCA cycle that is not fed by glutamine. Moreover, supraphysiologic pyruvate concentrations dose-dependently increase the effector functions of NK cells. Overall, this study highlights the role of exogenous pyruvate in NK cell biology, providing knowledge that could be exploited to boost NK cell potential in therapeutic settings.

abstract: Heterozygotic GATA6 mutations are responsible for various congenital diseases in the heart, pancreas, liver, and other organs in humans. However, there is lack of an animal that can comprehensively model these diseases since GATA6 is essential for early embryogenesis. Here, we report the establishment of a gata6 knockout zebrafish which recapitulates most of the symptoms in patients with GATA6 mutations, including cardiac outflow tract defects, pancreatic hypoplasia/agenesis, gallbladder agenesis, and various liver diseases. Particularly in the liver, the zebrafish gata6 model exhibits the paucity of intrahepatic bile ducts, disrupted bile canaliculi, cholestasis, resembling the liver diseases associated with GATA6 mutations. Moreover, an unreported phenotype, hepatic cysts, has been also revealed in the model. Mechanistically, Gata6 interacts with Hhex and binds lrh-1 promoter to synergistically activate its expression, thereby enhancing the Lrh-1-mediated β-catenin signaling which is essential for liver development. This transcriptional activation of lrh-1 is tightly controlled by the negative feedback, in which Lrh1 interacts with Gata6 to weaken its transactivation ability. Moreover, Gata6 level is regulated by Hhex-mediated proteasomal degradation. The orchestration by these three transcription factors precisely modulates Gata6 activity, ensuring β-catenin signaling output and proper liver development in zebrafish. Importantly, the molecular mechanism identified in zebrafish is conserved in human cells. GATA6 mutant variants associated with hepatobiliary malformations in humans interact aberrantly with HHEX, resulting in subsequent impairments of LRH-1 activation. Conclusively, the disease model established here provides both phenotypic and mechanism insights into the human hepatic diseases associated with GATA6 mutations.

abstract: Selecting the optimal dose of psilocybin for treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD) is crucial for clinical development and regulatory approval. This meta-analysis evaluates psilocybin's efficacy and safety in treating MDD to determine the optimal dose and timing for clinical trials. A systematic review and Dose-Response Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) of Randomized Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials (RCTs) registered with PROSPERO was conducted. Databases searched included Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, up to July 2024. The PICOS framework defined eligibility criteria: P: adult patients with MDD; I: psilocybin; C: placebo; O: changes in MADRS scores at Days 2, 8 and 15, and adverse events; S: RCT. Independent researchers performed data extraction and bias assessment. From 5419 search results, three RCTs involving 389 patients were included. Psilocybin significantly reduced symptoms compared to placebo at Day 8 (MD = -7.42; 95 % CI:10.07 to -4.78; p < 0.001) and Day 15 (MD = -9.55; 95 % CI:12.44 to -6.65; p < 0.001), without significant effects on Day 2. The NMA indicated that a 25 mg dose was the most effective, with a SUCRA value of 92.25 %, compared to doses of 0.215 mg/kg and 10 mg. However, psilocybin was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, particularly nausea (RR = 8.35; p < 0.001). This meta-analysis supports psilocybin's efficacy in treating MDD, particularly at a 25 mg dose, showing a time-dependent therapeutic effect. The recommended timing of efficacy evaluation by regulatory authorities is validated by this evidence, underscoring its importance in clinical trial design for psychedelic substances.

abstract: Many scholars have studied the relationship between obesity and periodontitis. The relationship between different obesity indicators and periodontitis seems to vary. In this study, we would like to explore the relationship between three commonly used obesity indicators, WWI (weight-adjusted-waist index), BMI (body mass index), WtHR (waist-to-height ratio), and periodontitis, and try to find the most clinically valuable indicators. The NHANES 2009-2014 provided the data for this study. 10,289, 10,600 and 10,290 participants were included to explore the relationship between WWI, BMI, WtHR and periodontitis respectively. Multiple logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, threshold effects analysis, and subgroup analysis were used to explore their relationships. WWI and periodontitis positively correlated in model III (OR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.26-1.45, p < 0.001). This result persisted after the quartile for WWI was created. Furthermore, in smooth curve fitting, the relationship between WWI and periodontitis with an inflection point of 12.68 was observed. In the fully adjusted model, WtHR also showed a positive correlation with periodontitis (OR = 2.94; 95% CI, 1.57-5.50, p < 0.001). However, BMI did not express a significant association with periodontitis either as a continuous or categorical variable. This cross-sectional study exposed a positive correlation between WWI, WtHR and periodontitis and this positive correlation showed an age difference.

abstract: The intestinal barrier function is a critical defense mechanism in the human body, serving as both the primary target and initiating organ in cases of sepsis. Preserving the integrity of this barrier is essential for preventing complications and diseases, including sepsis and mortality. Despite this importance, the impact of resveratrol on intestinal barrier function remains unclear. Thus, this study aims to explore the potential beneficial effects of resveratrol on maintaining intestinal barrier function. Fifteen male Sprague Dawley rats, weighing between 180 g and 220 g, were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the control group (Con), the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group, and the resveratrol (RSV) group. The resveratrol group received an intravenous administration of resveratrol at a dosage of 8 mg/kg, 10 min prior to lipopolysaccharide treatment. Each group comprised five rats. Various techniques including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE), periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Western blot analysis (WB), and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were utilized to assess differences in inflammatory cytokine expression, histopathological changes, apoptosis, tight junction (TJ) protein, and the TLR4/MyD88/NF-кB signaling pathways. Resveratrol exhibited anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, interleukin(IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, while increasing interleukin (IL)-10. Additionally, in rats treated with resveratrol, there was a reduction in the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins Bax and Caspase-3. Resveratrol also significantly increased the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins (TJ), and decreased the levels of intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) and D-lactic acid (D-LA). Furthermore, the expression of proteins in the related signaling pathways TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB was decreased. Resveratrol has been shown to reduce the expression of intestinal apoptotic proteins, enhance the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins, and inhibit the inflammatory response mediated by the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby alleviating LPS-induced septic intestinal injury.

abstract: Tirzepatide is a first-in-class dual agonist at receptors for glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) for the treatment of T2D and obesity with unprecedented efficacy for glycaemic control and reductions in body weight as well as improvements in blood pressure and lipid profile compared with placebo and GLP-1 receptor agonists. To date, clinical trials of tirzepatide have fulfilled the requirement by regulatory authorities of demonstrated cardiovascular safety in high-risk patients. Whether cardiovascular benefits will be found with dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists remains uncertain, and the contribution of GIP receptor activation to cardiovascular risk has not been established. Several ongoing large-scale cardiovascular outcome trials for tirzepatide will provide a clearer understanding of where tirzepatide should be positioned in the treatment of established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or people at high risk, in relation to current standard of care cardioprotective agents and approaches.

abstract: Dementia refers to an umbrella phenotype of many different underlying pathologies with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the most common type. Neuropathological examination remains the gold standard for accurate AD diagnosis, however, most that we know about AD genetics is based on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of clinically defined AD. Such studies have identified multiple AD susceptibility variants with a significant portion of the heritability unexplained and highlighting the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of the clinically defined entity. Furthermore, despite women's increased susceptibility to dementia, there is a lack of sex-specific genetic studies and understanding of sex-specific background for the disorder. Here, we aim to tackle the heterogeneity of AD by specifically concentrating on neuropathological features and pursuing sex-specific analysis. We bring together 14 different genomic and neuropathology datasets (6960 individuals) and we integrate our GWAS findings with transcriptomic and phenotypic data aiming to also identify biomarkers for AD progression. We uncover novel genetic associations to AD neuropathology, including BIN1 and OPCML. Our sex-specific analysis points to a role for BIN1 specifically in women as well as novel AD loci including QRFPR and SGCZ. Post-GWAS analyses illuminate the functional and biological mechanisms underlying AD and reveal sex-specific differences. Finally, through PheWAS and Mendelian Randomization analysis, we identify causal links with AD neuropathology pointing to disrupted lipid metabolism, as well as impaired peripheral immune response and liver dysfunction as part of a vicious cycle that fuels neurodegeneration.

abstract: Plant cuticular waxes serve as highly responsive adaptations to variable environments1-7. Aliphatic waxes consist of very-long-chain (VLC) compounds produced from 1-alcohol- or alkane-forming pathways5,8. The existing variation in 1-alcohols and alkanes across Arabidopsis accessions revealed that 1-alcohol amounts are negatively correlated with aridity factors, whereas alkanes display the opposite behaviour. How carbon resources are allocated between the 1-alcohol and alkane pathways responding to environmental stimuli is still largely unknown. Here, in Arabidopsis, we report a novel 1-alcohol biosynthesis pathway in which VLC acyl-CoAs are first reduced to aldehydes by CER3 and then converted into 1-alcohols via a newly identified putative aldehyde reductase SOH1. CER3, previously shown to interact with CER1 in alkane synthesis, is identified to interact with SOH1 as well, channelling wax precursors into either alcohol- or alkane-forming pathways, and the directional shunting of these precursors is tightly regulated by the SOH1-CER3-CER1 module in response to environmental conditions.

abstract: Neutrophils have a pivotal role in safeguarding the host against pathogens and facilitating tissue remodeling. They possess a large array of tools essential for executing these functions. Neutrophils have a critical role in cancer, where they are largely associated with negative clinical outcome and resistance to therapy. However, the specific role of neutrophils in cancer is complex and controversial, owing to their high functional diversity and acute sensitivity to the microenvironment. In this Perspective, we discuss the accumulated evidence that suggests that the functional diversity of neutrophils can be ascribed to two principal functional states, each with distinct characteristics: classically activated neutrophils and pathologically activated immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells. We discuss how the antimicrobial factors in neutrophils can contribute to tumor progression and the fundamental mechanisms that govern the pathologically activated myeloid-derived suppressor cells. These functional states play divergent roles in cancer and thus require separate consideration in therapeutic targeting.

abstract: Lung fibrosis development utilizes alveolar macrophages, with mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Here, we fate map connective tissue during mouse lung fibrosis and observe disassembly and transfer of connective tissue macromolecules from pleuro-alveolar junctions (PAJs) into deep lung tissue, to activate fibroblasts and fibrosis. Disassembly and transfer of PAJ macromolecules into deep lung tissue occurs by alveolar macrophages, activating cysteine-type proteolysis on pleural mesothelium. The PAJ niche and the disassembly cascade is active in patient lung biopsies, persists in chronic fibrosis models, and wanes down in acute fibrosis models. Pleural-specific viral therapeutic carrying the cysteine protease inhibitor Cystatin A shuts down PAJ disassembly, reverses fibrosis and regenerates chronic fibrotic lungs. Targeting PAJ disassembly by targeting the pleura may provide a unique therapeutic avenue to treat lung fibrotic diseases.

abstract: Gliomas are the most common brain tumor type in children and adolescents. To date, diagnosis and therapy monitoring for these tumors rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathological as well as molecular analyses of tumor tissue. Recently, liquid biopsies (LB) have emerged as promising tool for diagnosis and longitudinal tumor assessment potentially allowing for a more precise therapeutic management. However, the optimal strategy for monitoring gliomas by LB remains to be determined. In this study, we analyzed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from 78 liquid biopsies (plasma n = 44, cerebrospinal fluid n = 34 (CSF)) of 35 glioma patients, determining H3F3A K28M (K27M) and BRAF V600E mutation allele frequency using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). All results were correlated to clinically relevant parameters including diagnostic imaging and CSF aspiration site (ventricular vs lumbar) with respect to tumor localization. Regarding diagnostic accuracy, the calculated sensitivity score in the H3F3A K27M cohort was 84.61% for CSF and 73.68% for plasma. In the BRAF V600E cohort, we determined a sensitivity of 83.3% in plasma and 80% in CSF. The overall specificity was 100%. With respect to the CSF aspiration, the intra-operatively obtained CSF demonstrated 100% detection rate, followed by ventricular CSF obtained via Ommaya Reservoir/shunt puncture (93%) and CSF obtained via lumbar puncture (66%). Notably, this further correlated with the proximity of the CSF site to tumor localization. Longitudinal CSF monitoring demonstrated a good correlation to clinical and radiological disease evolution. Importantly, we show for the first time that monitoring BRAF V600E by ddPCR could serve as treatment response assessment in gliomas. In summary, our observation may inform recommendations with regard to location of CSF aspiration when incorporating LB into future treatment protocols.

abstract: Introduction:
        
      
      The periodontal ligament (PDL), a dynamic connective tissue that anchors teeth to the alveolar bone, enables tooth retention and facilitates continuous turnover. The integrity of the periodontium is maintained by periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs), whose dysfunction and senescence with age can disrupt tissue homeostasis, hinder injury repair, and lead to tooth loss, ultimately impacting overall health. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is known for its regenerative properties and as a functional paracrine factor in stem cell therapy, but its precise role in modulating PDLSC activity remains controversial and poorly understood.

abstract: Apigenin (C15H10O5, API) is a natural flavonoid widely found in vegetables, fruits, and plants such as celery, oranges, and chamomile. In recent years, API has attracted considerable attention as a dietary supplement due to its low toxicity, non-mutagenic properties and remarkable therapeutic efficacy in various diseases. In particular, evidence from a large number of preclinical studies suggests that API has promising effects in the prevention and treatment of a variety of liver diseases, including multifactorial liver injury, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis and liver cancer. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the progress of research into the therapeutic applications of API in liver diseases as of August 2024, based on literature retrieved from databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, CNKI, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect. The hepatoprotective effects of API involve multiple molecular mechanisms, including inhibition of inflammation, alleviation of hepatic oxidative stress, amelioration of insulin resistance, promotion of fatty acid oxidation, inhibition of liver cancer cell proliferation and differentiation, and induction of tumour cell apoptosis. More importantly, signaling pathways such as Nrf2, NF-κB, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, NLRP3, Wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β1/Smad3, AMPK/SREBP, PPARα/γ, MAPKs, and Caspases are identified as key targets through which API exerts its beneficial effects in various liver diseases. Studies on its toxicity and pharmacokinetics indicate that API has low toxicity, is slowly metabolized and excreted in vivo, and has low oral bioavailability. In addition, the paper summarises and discusses the sources, physicochemical properties, new dosage forms, and current challenges and opportunities of API, with the aim of providing direction and rationale for the further development and clinical application of API in the food, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical fields.

abstract: Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are bifunctional molecules that induce selective protein degradation by linking an E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme to a target protein. This approach allows scope for targeting "undruggable" proteins, and several PROTACs have reached the stage of clinical candidates. However, the roles of cellular transmembrane transporters in PROTAC uptake and efflux remain underexplored. Here, we utilized transporter-focused genetic screens to identify the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCC1/MRP1 as a key PROTAC resistance factor. Unlike the previously identified inducible PROTAC exporter ABCB1/MDR1, ABCC1 is highly expressed among cancers of various origins and constitutively restricts PROTAC bioavailability. Moreover, in a genome-wide PROTAC resistance screen, we identified candidates involved in processes such as ubiquitination, mTOR signaling, and apoptosis as genetic factors involved in PROTAC resistance. In summary, our findings reveal ABCC1 as a crucial constitutively active efflux pump limiting PROTAC efficacy in various cancer cells, offering insights for overcoming drug resistance.

abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) represent new anticancer agents and have been used worldwide. However, ICI can potentially induce life-threatening severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR), such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), hindering continuous ICI therapy. We examine 6 cohorts including 25 ICI-induced SJS/TEN patients and conduct single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, which shows overexpression of macrophage-derived CXCL10 that recruits CXCR3+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in blister cells from ICI-SJS/TEN skin lesions. ScRNA expression profiles and ex vivo blocking studies further identify TNF signaling as a pathway responsible for macrophage-derived CXCL10 and CTL activation. Based on the trajectory analysis, ICI-activated T cells from whole blood are proposed to serve as the initial cells involved in inflammation, that lead to monocytes differentiating into macrophages and increasing their susceptibility to migrate to the lesion sites. Compared with systemic corticosteroids treatment, ICI-induced SJS/TEN patients treated with biologic TNF blockade showed a significantly rapid recovery and no recurrence of SCAR with continuous ICI therapy. Our findings identify that macrophage-eliciting CTL contribute to the pathogenesis of ICI-induced epidermal necrolysis and provide potential therapeutic targets for the management and prevention of SCAR induced by ICI therapy.

abstract: GT103 is a first-in-class, fully human, IgG3 monoclonal antibody targeting complement factor H that kills tumor cells and promotes anti-cancer immunity in preclinical models. We conducted a first-in-human phase 1b study dose escalation trial of GT103 in refractory non-small cell lung cancer to assess the safety of GT103 (NCT04314089). Dose escalation was performed using a "3 + 3" schema with primary objectives of determining safety, tolerability, PK profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GT103. Secondary objectives included describing objective response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival. Dose escalation cohorts included GT103 given intravenously at 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks, and 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Thirty one patients were enrolled across 3 institutions. Two dose-limiting adverse events were reported: grade 3 acute kidney injury (0.3 mg/kg) and grade 2 colitis (1 mg/kg). No dose-limiting toxicities were noted at the highest dose levels and the MTD was not reached. No objective responses were seen. Stable disease occurred in 9 patients (29%) and the median overall survival was 25.7 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.1-30.6). Pharmacokinetic analysis confirmed an estimated half life of 6.5 days. The recommended phase 2 dose of GT103 was 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, however further dose optimization is needed given the absence of an MTD. The study achieved its primary objective of demonstrating safety and tolerability of GT103 in refractory NSCLC.

abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has transformed the treatment landscape for hematological cancers. However, achieving comparable success in solid tumors remains challenging. Factors contributing to these limitations include the scarcity of tumor-specific antigens (TSAs), insufficient CAR-T cell infiltration, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Vaccine-based strategies are emerging as potential approaches to address these challenges, enhancing CAR-T cell expansion, persistence, and antitumor efficacy. In this review, we explore diverse vaccine modalities, including mRNA, peptide, viral vector, and dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines, and their roles in augmenting CAR-T cell responses. Special focus is given to recent clinical advancements combining mRNA-based vaccines with CAR-T therapy for the treatment of genitourinary cancers. In addition, we discuss crucial considerations for optimizing vaccine dosing, scheduling, and delivery to maximize CAR-T synergy, aiming to refine this combination strategy to improve treatment efficacy and safety.

abstract: C1QBP exhibits heightened expression across a spectrum of tumours, thereby fostering their proliferation and metastasis, rendering it a pivotal therapeutic target. Nevertheless, to date, no pharmacological agents capable of directly targeting and inducing the degradation of C1QBP have been identified. In this study, we have unveiled a new peptide, PDBAG1, derived from the precursor protein GPD1, employing a peptidomics-based drug screening strategy. PDBAG1 has demonstrated substantial efficacy in suppressing triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) both in vitro and in vivo. Its mechanism of action involves mitochondrial impairment and the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), achieved through direct binding to C1QBP, thereby promoting its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Concomitantly, due to metabolic adaptability, we have observed an up-regulation of glycolysis to compensate for OXPHOS inhibition. We observed an aberrant phenomenon wherein the hypoxia signalling pathway in tumour cells exhibited significant activation under normoxic conditions following PDBAG1 treatment. Through size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays, we have validated that PDBAG1 is capable of binding C1QBP with a Kd value of 334 nM. Furthermore, PDBAG1 inhibits homologous recombination repair proteins and facilitates synergism with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors in cancer therapy. This underscores that PDBAG1 ultimately induces insurmountable survival stress through multiple mechanisms while concurrently engendering therapeutic vulnerabilities specific to TNBC. KEY POINTS: The newly discovered peptide PDBAG1 is the first small molecule substance found to directly target and degrade C1QBP, demonstrating significant tumour inhibitory effects and therapeutic potential.

abstract: Despite the enormous significance of malaria parasites for global health, some basic features of their ultrastructure remain obscure. Here, we apply high-resolution volumetric electron microscopy to examine and compare the ultrastructure of the transmissible male and female sexual blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum as well as the more intensively studied asexual blood stages revisiting previously described phenomena in 3D. In doing so, we challenge the widely accepted notion of a single mitochondrion by demonstrating the presence of multiple mitochondria in gametocytes. We also provide evidence for a gametocyte-specific cytostome, or cell mouth. Furthermore, we generate the first 3D reconstructions of the parasite's endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus as well as gametocyte-induced extraparasitic structures in the infected red blood cell. Assessing interconnectivity between organelles, we find frequent structural appositions between the nucleus, mitochondria, and apicoplast. We provide evidence that the ER is a promiscuous interactor with numerous organelles and the trilaminar pellicle of the gametocyte. Public availability of these volumetric electron microscopy resources will facilitate reinterrogation by others with different research questions and expertise. Taken together, we reconstruct the 3D ultrastructure of P. falciparum gametocytes at nanometre scale and shed light on the unique organellar biology of these deadly parasites.

abstract: Molecular glue degraders (MGDs) represent a unique class of targeted protein degradation (TPD) modalities. By facilitating protein-protein interactions between E3 ubiquitin ligases and neo-substrates, MGDs offer a novel approach to target previously undruggable or insufficiently drugged disease-causing proteins. Here, we present an overview of recently reported MGDs, highlighting their diverse mechanisms, and we discuss mechanism-based strategies to discover new MGDs and neo-substrates. These strategies include repurposing existing E3 ubiquitin ligase-targeting ligands, screening for novel binders to proteins of interest, and leveraging functional genomics and quantitative proteomics to probe the MGD mechanism of action. Despite their historically serendipitous discovery, MGDs are on their way to being rationally designed to deplete undesired proteins by purposely altering the evolutionarily conserved ligase:substrate interactions.

abstract: Cervical cancer (CC) is becoming a major health issue globally, and radiotherapy plays a crucial role in its treatment. However, the prognosis of some patients remains poor due to tumor resistance to the therapy. This study aimed to explore whether vitamin D could confer a more radiosensitive phenotype in CC based on our previous findings and detection using the database. We found that vitamin D sensitized vitamin D receptor (VDR)-positive CC cells (Siha and Caski) to the cytotoxic effects of radiation in vivo and in vitro. We examined conventional radiation-induced cell death, such as DNA damage and cell cycle arrest, in vitamin D-treated cells to detect the underlying mechanism, but no association was observed between them. Subsequently, our proteome analysis exhibited that autophagy was reduced in irradiated CCs treated with vitamin D, and apoptosis displayed the opposite effect. Moreover, we confirmed that vitamin D-pretreated irradiated cells displayed reduced autophagy activity mediated by the Ambra1 downregulation, and the elevation of apoptosis was attributed to the activation of caspase 8. Importantly, the pharmacological inhibition of caspases or the Ambra1 overexpression could restore tumor proliferation under the vitamin D and radiation combination treatment. Hence, the aforementioned findings revealed the essential impact of vitamin D in terms of enhancing radiosensitivity in CC meditated by inhibiting autophagy and proposed the addition of vitamin D as a viable strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of VDR-positive CC.

abstract: CDKN2A is a tumor suppressor located in chromosome 9p21 and frequently lost in Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). How CDKN2A and other 9p21 gene co-deletions affect EAC evolution remains understudied. We explored the effects of 9p21 loss in EACs and cancer progressor and non-progressor BEs with matched genomic, transcriptomic and clinical data. Despite its cancer driver role, CDKN2A loss in BE prevents EAC initiation by counterselecting subsequent TP53 alterations. 9p21 gene co-deletions predict poor patient survival in EAC but not BE through context-dependent effects on cell cycle, oxidative phosphorylation and interferon response. Immune quantifications using bulk transcriptome, RNAscope and high-dimensional tissue imaging showed that IFNE loss reduces immune infiltration in BE, but not EAC. Mechanistically, CDKN2A loss suppresses the maintenance of squamous epithelium, contributing to a more aggressive phenotype. Our study demonstrates context-dependent roles of cancer genes during disease evolution, with consequences for cancer detection and patient management.

abstract: Approximately 90% of glioblastoma recurrences occur in the peritumoral brain zone (PBZ), while the spatial heterogeneity of the PBZ is not well studied. In this study, two PBZ tissues and one tumor tissue sample are obtained from each patient via preoperative imaging. We assess the microenvironment and the characteristics of infiltrating immune/tumor cells using various techniques. Our data indicate there are one or more regions with higher cerebral blood flow in PBZ, which we collectively name the "higher cerebral blood flow interface" (HBI). The HBI exhibited more neovascularization than the "lower cerebral blood flow interfaces" (LBI). The HBI tend to have increased infiltration of macrophages and T lymphocytes infiltration compared with that in LBI. There are more tumor cells in the HBI than in LBI, with substantial differences in the gene expression profiles of these tumor cells. HBI may be the key area of PBZ-targeting therapy after surgical resection.

      Glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1DS) was initially reported by De Vivo and colleagues in 1991. This disease arises from mutations in the SLC2A1 and presents with a broad clinical spectrum. It is a treatable neuro-metabolic condition, where prompt diagnosis and initiation of ketogenic dietary therapy can markedly enhance the prognosis. However, due to its rarity, Glut1DS is susceptible to misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis, which can lead to delayed treatment and irreversible dysfunction of the central nervous system. To promote diagnostic awareness and effective treatments, the recommendations for diagnosis and treatment have been developed.

We generated a landscape of 170 lineages of 1894 polyethylene terephthalate depolymerase (PETase) candidates and performed profiling using sampling approaches with features associated with PET-degrading capabilities. We identified three promising yet unexplored PETase lineages and two potent PETases, Mipa-P and Kubu-P. An engineered variant of Kubu-P outperformed benchmarks in terms of PET depolymerization in harsh environments, such as those with high substrate load and ethylene glycol as the solvent.

abstract: Upregulation of Cyclin E1 and subsequent activation of CDK2 accelerates cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase and is a common oncogenic driver in gynecological malignancies. WEE1 kinase counteracts the effects of Cyclin E1/CDK2 activation by regulating multiple cell cycle checkpoints. Here we characterized the relationship between Cyclin E1/CDK2 activation and sensitivity to the selective WEE1 inhibitor azenosertib. We found that ovarian cancer cell lines with high levels of endogenous Cyclin E1 expression or forced overexpression were exquisitely sensitive to azenosertib and these results extended to in vivo models of ovarian and uterine serous carcinoma. Models with high Cyclin E1 expression showed higher baseline levels of replication stress and enhanced cellular responses to azenosertib treatment. We found azenosertib synergized with different classes of chemotherapy and described distinct underlying mechanisms. Finally, we provided early evidence from an ongoing phase I study demonstrating the clinical activity of monotherapy azenosertib in patients with Cyclin E1/CDK2-activated ovarian and uterine serous carcinomas.

abstract: From embryogenesis to aging, billions of cells perish daily in mammals. The multistep process by which phagocytes engulf these deceased cells without eliciting an inflammatory response is called efferocytosis. Despite significant insights into the fundamental mechanisms of efferocytosis, its implications in disorders such as aging and cancer remain elusive. Upon summarizing and analyzing existing studies on efferocytosis, it becomes evident that efferocytosis is our friend in resolving inflammation, yet it transforms into our foe by facilitating tumor development and metastasis. This review illuminates recent discoveries regarding the emerging mechanisms of efferocytosis in clearing apoptotic cells, explores its connections with aging, examines its influence on tumor development and metastasis, and identifies the regulatory factors of efferocytosis within the tumor microenvironment. A comprehensive understanding of these efferocytosis facets offers insights into crucial physiological and pathophysiological processes, paving the way for innovative therapeutic approaches to combat aging and cancer.

abstract: Prime editing enables precise and efficient genome editing, but its efficacy is hindered by pegRNA's 3' extension, forming secondary structures due to high complementarity with the protospacer. The continuous presence of the prime editing system also leads to unintended indel formation, raising safety concerns for therapeutic applications. To address these challenges, we develop a mismatched pegRNA (mpegRNA) strategy that introduces mismatched bases into the pegRNA protospacer, reducing complementarity and secondary structure formation, and preventing sustained activity. Our findings show that mpegRNA enhances editing efficiency by up to 2.3 times and reduces indel levels by 76.5% without compromising performance. Combining mpegRNA with epegRNA further increases efficiency up to 14-fold, or 2.4-fold in PE4max/PE5max systems, underscoring its potential in research and therapy. AlphaFold 3 analysis suggests that the optimal mpegRNA structure contributes significantly to improved editing outcomes. Overall, mpegRNA advances prime editing technology, improving efficiency while reducing indels.

abstract: Identifying broadly reactive B precursor cells and conserved epitopes is crucial for developing a universal flu vaccine. In this study, using influenza neuraminidase (NA) mutant probes, we find that human pre-existing NA-specific memory B cells (MBCs) account for ∼0.25% of total MBCs, which are heterogeneous and dominated by class-unswitched MBCs. In addition, we identify three NA broad-inhibition monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (BImAbs) that block the activity of NA derived from different influenza strains, including the recent cow H5N1. The cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure shows that the BImAb targets the conserved NA enzymatic pocket and a separate epitope in the neighboring NA monomer. Furthermore, the NA BImAbs protect mice from the lethal challenge of the human pandemic H1N1 and H5N1. Our work demonstrates that the NA broad-inhibition precursor MBCs exist in healthy adults and could be targeted by the NA-based universal flu vaccine.

abstract: Regulated cell death like pyroptosis is one vital cause of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), which eventually leads to heart failure. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD) is an adapter protein with multiple functions that participates in the pathophysiological progress of different cardiovascular disorders via regulating regulated cell death. Studies have shown that TRADD combines with receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and facilitates its activation, thereby mediating TNF-induced necroptosis. However, no direct relationship between TRADD and pyroptosis has been identified. In this study, we investigated the role and mechanisms of TRADD in pyroptosis during DCM. We established a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model and high glucose (HG)-treated cardiomyocytes model. We showed that the expression levels of TRADD were significantly increased in the hearts of diabetic mice and HG-treated cardiomyocytes. Knockdown of TRADD did not affect blood glucose and triglyceride levels, but significantly improved cardiac function, and attenuated myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and pyroptosis in the heart of diabetic mice. Furthermore, both knockdown of TRADD and application of TRADD inhibitor apostatin-1 (Apt-1, 10 μM) significantly ameliorated cell injury and pyroptosis in HG-treated cardiomyocytes. We demonstrated that HG treatment increased the expression of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and enhanced the binding of XBP1 to the TRADD promoter to elevate TRADD expression in the cardiomyocytes. Collectively, this study provides evidence that TRADD-mediated pyroptosis contributes to DCM, suggesting that strategies to inhibit TRADD activity may be a novel approach for DCM treatment.

abstract: Efficient prime editor (PE) delivery in vivo is critical for realizing its full potential in disease modeling and therapeutic correction. Although PE has been divided into two halves and delivered using dual adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), the editing efficiency at different gene loci varies among split sites. Furthermore, efficient split sites within Cas9 nickase (Cas9n) are limited. Here, we verified that 1115 (Asn) is an efficient split site when delivering PEs by dual AAVs. Additionally, we utilized a feature in which reverse transcriptase could be detached from the Cas9n and designed split sites in the first half of Cas9n. We found that split-PE-367 enabled high editing efficiency with Rma intein. To test the editing efficiency in vivo, split-ePE3-367 was packaged in AAV9 and achieved 17.5% precise editing in mice. Our findings establish an alternative split-PE architecture that enables robust editing efficiency, facilitating potential utility in disease modeling and correction.

abstract: Gut dysbiosis serves as an underlying risk factor for the development of hypertension. The resolution of this dysbiosis has emerged as a promising strategy in improving hypertension. Food-derived bioactive protein peptides have become increasingly more attractive in ameliorating hypertension, primarily due to their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. However, the regulatory mechanisms linking rice peptides (RP), gut dysbiosis, and hypertension remain to be fully elucidated. In our study, male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were fed with chow diet and concomitantly treated with ddH2O (Ctrl) or varying doses of rice peptides (20, 100, or 500 mg (kg bw day)-1 designated as low-dose RP, LRP; medium-dose RP, MRP; high-dose RP, HAP) or captopril (Cap) by intragastric administration. Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats served as the normotensive control group and were orally administered with ddH2O. We observed beneficial effects of RP in lowering blood pressure and ameliorating cardiovascular risk profiles, as evidenced by improvements in glucolipid metabolic disorders, hepatic and renal damage, left ventricular hypertrophy and endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive rats. More importantly, we found that RP attenuated intestinal pathological damage, improved impaired intestinal barrier, and reduced intestinal inflammation by inhibiting the HMGB1-TLR4-NF-κB pathway. Notably, multi-omics integrative analyses have revealed that RP altered the composition and function of the gut microbiota. This is exemplified by the observed enrichment of beneficial bacterial constituents, such as g_Lactobacillus, g_Lactococcus, s_Lactobacillus_intestinalis, and Lactococcus lactis, and elevated production of microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acid metabolites. Collectively, these studies suggest that the hypotensive effects of RP may be associated with modulation of the gut microbiota and its short-chain fatty acids metabolites. This implicates the microbiota-gut-HMGB1-TLR4-NF-κB axis as a novel venue for the amelioration of hypertension and its complications.

abstract: Sensory disabilities have been identified as significant risk factors for dementia but underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. In different Drosophila models with loss of sensory input, we observe non-autonomous induction of the integrated stress response (ISR) deep in the brain, as indicated by eIF2αS50 phosphorylation-dependent elevated levels of the ISR effectors ATF4 and XRP1. Unlike during canonical ISR, however, the ATF4 and XRP1 transcription factors are enriched in cytosolic granules that are positive for RNA and the stress granule markers Caprin, FMR1, and p62, and are reversible upon restoration of vision for blind flies. Cytosolic restraint of the ATF4 and XRP1 transcription factors dampens expression of their downstream targets including genes of cell death pathways activated during chronic cellular stress and thus constitutes a chronic stress protective response (CSPR). Cytosolic granules containing both p62 and ATF4 are also evident in the thalamus and hippocampus of mouse models of congenital or degenerative blindness. These data indicate a conserved link between loss of sensory input and curbed stress responses critical for protein quality control in the brain.

abstract: Mitochondrial endonuclease G (EndoG) contributes to chromosomal degradation when it is released from mitochondria during apoptosis. It is presumed to also have a mitochondrial function because EndoG deficiency causes mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the mechanism by which EndoG regulates mitochondrial function is not known. Fat accumulation in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which is more common in men, is caused in part by mitochondrial dysfunction. EndoG expression is reduced in MASLD liver, and EndoG deficiency causes MASLD in an obesity-independent manner but only in males. EndoG promotes mitochondrial respiration by resolving mitochondrial tRNA/DNA hybrids formed during mtDNA transcription by recruiting RNA helicase DHX30 to unwind them. EndoG also cleaves off the 3'-end of the H-strand transcript that can prevent mt-tRNAThr precursor cloverleaf-folding, and processing, which increases mt-tRNAThr production and mitochondrial translation. Using fluorescent lifetime imaging microscopy technology to visualize oxygen consumption at the individual mitochondrion level, we found that EndoG deficiency leads to the selective loss of a mitochondrial subpopulation with high-oxygen consumption. This defect was reversed with mt-tRNAThr supplementation. Thus, EndoG promotes mitochondrial respiration by selectively regulating the production of mt-tRNAThr in male mice.

abstract: Oxidative stress, caused by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is a pathological factor in several incurable neurodegenerative conditions as well as in stroke. However, our knowledge of the genetic elements that can be manipulated to protect neurons from oxidative stress-induced cell death is still very limited. Here, using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system, combined with the optogenetic tool KillerRed to spatially and temporally control ROS generation, we identify a previously uncharacterized gene, oxidative stress protective 1 (osp-1), that protects C. elegans neurons from oxidative damage. Using rodent and human cell cultures, we also show that the protective effect of OSP-1 extends to mammalian cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that OSP-1 functions in a strictly cell-autonomous fashion, and that it localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it has an ER-remodeling function. Finally, we present evidence suggesting that OSP-1 may exert its neuroprotective function by influencing autophagy. Our results point to a potential role of OSP-1 in modulating autophagy, and suggest that overactivation of this cellular process could contribute to neuronal death triggered by oxidative damage.

abstract: Norepinephrine (NE) released from locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic (NAergic) neurons plays a pivotal role in the regulation of olfactory behaviors. However, the precise circuits and receptor mechanisms underlying this function are not well understood. Here, in DBH-Cre mice model, we show that LC NAergic neurons project directly to both anterior piriform cortex (aPC) and the olfactory bulb (OB). By using pharmacological and optogenetic manipulations in vitro and in vivo, we found that NE reduces the excitability of aPC pyramidal neurons directly via α2 receptors and that it bidirectionally regulates the activity of OB mitral cells via modulation of inhibitory inputs. Activation of the NAergic projection reduced both spontaneous and odor-evoked activity in the aPC/OB in awake mice, enhanced the odor-decoding ability of the aPC, and decreased the odor-decoding ability of the OB. Furthermore, activation of LC-aPC/OB NAergic projections accelerated odor discrimination and specific inactivation of the LC-aPC/OB NAergic pathway impaired olfactory detection and discrimination. These findings identify the mechanism underlying NAergic modulation of the aPC/OB and elucidate its role in odor processing and olfactory behaviors.

abstract: Accurate diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases require reliable biomarkers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins are promising candidates for reflecting brain pathology; however, their diagnostic utility may be compromised by natural variability between individuals, weakening their association with disease. Here, we measured the levels of 69 pre-selected proteins in cerebrospinal fluid using antibody-based suspension bead array technology in a multi-disease cohort of 499 individuals with neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), corticobasal syndrome, primary supranuclear palsy, along with healthy controls. We identify significant inter-individual variability in overall CSF levels of brain-derived proteins, which could not be attributed to specific disease associations. Using linear modelling, we show that adjusting for median CSF levels of brain-derived proteins increases the diagnostic accuracy of proteins previously identified as altered in CSF in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. We further demonstrate a simplified approach for the adjustment using pairs of correlated proteins with opposite alteration in the diseases. With this approach, the proteins adjust for each other and further increase the biomarker performance through additive effect. When comparing the diseases, two proteins-neurofilament medium and myelin basic protein-showed increased levels in ALS compared to other diseases, and neurogranin showed a specific increase in AD. Several other proteins showed similar trends across the studied diseases, indicating that these proteins likely reflect shared processes related to neurodegeneration. Overall, our findings suggest that accounting for inter-individual variability is crucial in future studies to improve the identification and performance of relevant biomarkers. Importantly, we highlight the need for multi-disease studies to identify disease-specific biomarkers.

This study investigates the association between the TyG index and H. pylori infection. The study utilized cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted between 1999 and 2000. Participants underwent serologic testing for H. pylori, and the TyG index was calculated from fasting laboratory measurements. Multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline methods were used to assess the association and explore the dose-response relationship. The analysis included 2984 participants. Elevated TyG index values were associated with an increased likelihood of H. pylori infection. The risk of infection rose with higher TyG index quartiles, with the highest quartile showing the most significant increase (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.15-2.07, P = 0.004). A linear relationship between the TyG index and H. pylori infection was demonstrated. The study findings indicate a significant positive association between the TyG index and H. pylori infection. This association highlights the importance of metabolic health in the context of H. pylori infection and suggests that further research is needed to explore the potential implications for health promotion strategies.

abstract: Millions of men and women suffer from alopecia, especially androgenic alopecia (AGA), which is considered the most common form of hair loss. The available treatments for hair loss include multiple approaches, with the most popular being synthetic drugs including minoxidil and finasteride, in addition to natural products. However, synthetic drugs have shown many undesirable side effects, on the contrary, the specifications of the commonly used natural drugs have not been reported in most of the previous studies, despite the high market preference for them. One of these natural drugs is soybean (Glycine max), an economically important bean that has been reported in several studies to effectively prevent hair loss in humans and is widely used in many products treating alopecia. However, no reports were traced on the specification and standardization of the used soybean extract, which may lead to unreproducible results. Thus, in this study, we investigated the effects of different concentrations; 1%, 3%, and 5% (v/v) of a specified soybean extract (SSE) in coconut oil, using a testosterone-induced model of alopecia in adult male Wistar rats in comparison with a 2% finasteride solution. Visual and microscopical evaluations of follicular diameter, length, and density were performed. The data showed that 5% of SSE exhibited the highest activity with results comparable to standard 2% finasteride for hair diameter, length, and density, which could be attributed to the extract's isoflavone content. Genistin and diadzin isoflavones were isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction of the SSE. The total extract was standardized using high-performance liquid chromatography using genistin as a marker and showed a content of 6.2 µg/mL. Accordingly, the formulated 3% and 5% SSEs (containing 0.186 and 0.31 µg/mL of genistin, respectively) could be considered as a promising natural treatment for AGA.

abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are associated with intercellular communications, immune responses, viral pathogenicity, cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and cancer progression. EVs deliver proteins, metabolites, and nucleic acids into recipient cells to effectively alter their physiological and biological response. During their transportation from the donor to the recipient cell EVs face differential ionic concentrations, which can be detrimental to their integrity and impact their cargo content. EVs are known to possess ion channels and transporters in their membrane but neither the function nor the role of these channels in EVs is known. In this study, we discover a functional calcium-activated large-conductance potassium channel (BKCa) in the membrane of EVs. Furthermore, we establish that BKCa is essential for the structural and functional integrity of EVs. Together, these findings establish the critical role of ion channels such as BKCa in functioning as gatekeepers and maintaining EV-mediated signaling.

abstract: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a highly effective therapy for malignant blood illnesses that pose a high risk, as well as diseases that are at risk due to other variables, such as genetics. However, the prevalence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has impeded its widespread use. Ensuring the stability of microbial varieties and associated metabolites is crucial for supporting metabolic processes, preventing pathogen intrusion, and modulating the immune system. Consequently, it significantly affects the overall well-being and susceptibility of the host to disease. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) may experience a disruption in the balance between the immune system and gut bacteria when treated with medicines and foreign cells. This can lead to secondary intestinal inflammation and GVHD. Thus, GM is both a reliable indicator of post-transplant mortality and a means of enhancing GVHD prevention and treatment after allo-HSCT. This can be achieved through various strategies, including nutritional support, probiotics, selective use of antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to target gut microbes. This review examines research advancements and the practical use of intestinal bacteria in GVHD following allo-HSCT. These findings may offer novel insights into the prevention and treatment of GVHD after allo-HSCT.

abstract: The standard dengue virus (DENV) neutralization assay inconsistently predicts dengue protection. We compare how IgG ELISA, envelope domain III (EDIII), or non-structural protein 1 (NS1) binding antibodies, and titers from plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) using standard and mature viruses are associated with dengue. The ELISA measures IgG antibodies that bind to inactivated DENV1-4. The EDIII and NS1 assays measure binding antibodies, and the PRNTs measure neutralizing antibodies to each specific DENV serotype. Healthy children (n = 1206) in Cebu, Philippines were followed for 5 years. ELISA IgG≥3 was associated with reduced dengue probability relative to naïve children (3% vs. 10%, p = 0.007). Serotype-specific antibodies binding EDIII or NS1 had no association with dengue risk. Standard virus PRNT geometric mean titers (GMT) > 200 and mature GMT > 100 were associated with reduced dengue disease overall (p < 0.01). High DENV2 and DENV3 titers against either standard or mature viruses protected against the matched serotype (p < 0.01). While 43% of dengue cases had standard virus PRNT titers>100, only 2% of cases had mature virus PRNT titers>100 (p < 0.001), indicating a lower, more consistent threshold for protection. These assays may serve as correlates of protection.

abstract: Green tea (Camellia sinensis) is a commonly consumed beverage or dietary supplement. As a natural product with a myriad of proposed health benefits, patients are likely to consume green tea while taking their medications unaware of its potential to interact with drugs and influence drug efficacy and safety. Catechins are the abundant polyphenolic compounds in green tea (e.g., (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate), which are reported to influence determinants of drug pharmacokinetics, such as drug solubility and the activity of drug transporters and drug metabolizing enzymes. This review summarized the results of clinical studies investigating the influence of green tea catechins on the pharmacokinetics of clinically used medications. The majority of analyses (72%) reported significant decreases (by 18-99%) in systemic drug exposure with green tea consumption (atorvastatin, celiprolol, digoxin, fexofenadine, folic acid, lisinopril, nadolol, nintedanib, raloxifene, and rosuvastatin). One analysis (6%) reported a 50% increase in drug systemic exposure (sildenafil) and for 22% of analyses drug pharmacokinetics were not affected by green tea consumption (fluvastatin, pseudoephedrine, simvastatin, and tamoxifen). For most drugs reporting an interaction, green tea catechins were proposed to decrease intestinal drug absorption by inhibiting OATP uptake (particularly OATP1A2), enhancing P-gp efflux activity or reducing drug solubility. Case reports have associated changes in drug pharmacokinetics with green tea consumption to changes in drug efficacy or safety (e.g., nadolol and erlotinib). These findings prompt the need for further research in relating evidence from existing literature to predict additional clinically important green tea-drug interactions and to provide appropriate recommendations for patients and clinicians.

abstract: Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by progressive lung scarring, leading to a decline in lung function and an increase in morbidity and mortality. This study leverages single-cell sequencing and machine learning to unravel the complex cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying pulmonary fibrosis, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and uncover potential therapeutic targets. By analyzing lung tissue samples from pulmonary fibrosis patients, we identified distinct cellular phenotypes and gene expression patterns that contribute to the fibrotic process. Notably, our findings revealed a significant enrichment of activated B cells, CD4 T cells, macrophages, and specific fibroblast subpopulations in fibrotic versus normal lung tissue. Machine learning analysis further refined these observations, resulting in the development of a diagnostic model with enhanced precision, based on key gene signatures including TMEM52B, PHACTR1, and BLVRB. Comparative analysis with existing diagnostic models demonstrates the superior accuracy and specificity of our approach. Through In vitro experiments involving the knockdown of PHACTR1, TMEM52B, and BLVRB genes demonstrated that these genes play crucial roles in inhibiting the expression of α-SMA and collagen in lung fibroblasts induced by TGF-β. Additionally, knockout of the PHACTR1 gene reduced inflammation and collagen deposition in a bleomycin-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. Additionally, our study highlights novel gene signatures and immune cell profiles associated with pulmonary fibrosis, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets. This research underscores the importance of integrating advanced technologies like single-cell sequencing and machine learning to deepen our understanding of pulmonary fibrosis and pave the way for personalized therapeutic strategies.

abstract: Despite the recent breakthrough in structure determination and prediction of proteins, the structural investigation of carbohydrates remains a challenge. Here, we report the cryo-EM analysis of a glycofibril found in the freshwater in the Tsinghua Lotus Pond. The fibril, which we name TLP-4, is made of a linear chain of tetrapeptide repeats coated with >4 nm thick glycans. In each repeat, two glycans are O-linked to a 3,4-dihydroxyproline and another glycan attaches to the adjacent Ser or Thr. The fibril structure is entirely maintained through glycan packing. Bioinformatic analysis confirms the conservation of the TLP-4 repeats across species, suggesting the existence of a large number of glycofibrils to be discovered. Our findings not only provide valuable insights into the structural roles of glycans in bio-assemblies but also demonstrate the potential of our recently formulated research strategy of CryoSeek to find bioentities and establish prototypes for structural studies of carbohydrates.

abstract: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are widely used for nucleic acid delivery but face challenges like limited targeting and accelerated blood clearance (ABC) effect. We design three ionizable oligomers (IOs) that, with polylactide-polyethylene glycol (PLA-PEG), form a potential siRNA delivery system, named Ionizable Polymeric Micelles (IPMs). The siRNA encapsulated IPMs escape from lysosomes upon cellular uptake, and silence the target gene. A fibroblast activation protein inhibitor modified IPMs (FAPi-IPMs) show higher targeting for activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) compared to that for hepatocytes, silencing both HSP47 and HMGB1, reducing collagen secretion and liver inflammation, thereby treating fibrosis. Moreover, IPMs and FAPi-IPMs mitigate ABC effect and produce fewer PEG antibodies than LNPs, and show minimal apolipoprotein adsorption in vivo compared with LNPs, differentiating their targeting effects from LNPs. In conclusion, IPMs represent a nucleic acid delivery system with alternative targeting ability and reduced ABC effect.

abstract: Background:
        
      
      X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a female-specific process in which one X chromosome is silenced to balance X-linked gene expression between the sexes. XCI is initiated in early development by upregulation of the lncRNA Xist on the future inactive X (Xi). A subset of X-linked genes escape silencing and thus have higher expression in females, suggesting female-specific functions. One of these genes is the highly conserved gene Kdm6a, which encodes a histone demethylase that removes methyl groups at H3K27 to facilitate gene expression. KDM6A mutations have been implicated in congenital disorders such as Kabuki Syndrome, as well as in sex differences in development and cancer.

abstract: Bone morphogenetic proteins are essential for bone regeneration/fracture healing but can also induce heterotopic ossification (HO). Understanding accessory factors modulating BMP signaling would provide both a means of enhancing BMP-dependent regeneration while preventing HO. This study focuses on the ability of the collagen receptor, discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2), to regulate BMP activity. As will be shown, induction of bone formation by subcutaneous BMP2 implants is severely compromised in Ddr2-deficient mice. In addition, Ddr2 deficiency attenuates HO in mice expressing the ACVR1 mutation associated with human fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. In cells migrating into BMP2 implants, DDR2 is co-expressed with GLI1, a skeletal stem cell marker, and DDR2/GLI1-positive cells participate in BMP2-induced bone formation where they contribute to chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages. Consistent with this distribution, conditional knockout of Ddr2 in Gli1-expressing cells inhibited bone formation to the same extent seen in globally Ddr2-deficient animals. This response was explained by selective inhibition of Gli1+ cell proliferation without changes in apoptosis. The basis for this DDR2 requirement was explored further using bone marrow stromal cells. Although Ddr2 deficiency inhibited BMP2-dependent chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation and in vivo, bone formation, early BMP responses including SMAD phosphorylation remained largely intact. Instead, Ddr2 deficiency reduced the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of the Hippo pathway intermediates, YAP and TAZ. This suggests that DDR2 regulates Hippo pathway-mediated responses to the collagen matrix, which subsequently affect BMP responsiveness. In summary, DDR2 is an important modulator of BMP signaling and a potential therapeutic target both for enhancing regeneration and treating HO.

abstract: The lack of a robust system to reproducibly propagate HRV-C, a family of viruses refractory to cultivation in standard cell lines, has substantially hindered our understanding of this common respiratory pathogen. We sought to develop an organoid-based system to reproducibly propagate HRV-C, and characterize virus-host interaction using respiratory organoids. We demonstrate that airway organoids sustain serial virus passage with the aid of CYT387-mediated immunosuppression, whereas nasal organoids that more closely simulate the upper airway achieve this without any intervention. Nasal organoids are more susceptible to HRV-C than airway organoids. Intriguingly, upon HRV-C infection, we observe an innate immune response that is stronger in airway organoids than in nasal organoids, which is reproduced in a Poly(I:C) stimulation assay. Treatment with α-CDHR3 and antivirals significantly reduces HRV-C viral growth in airway and nasal organoids. Additionally, an organoid-based immunofluorescence assay is established to titrate HRV-C infectious particles. Collectively, we develop an organoid-based system to reproducibly propagate the poorly cultivable HRV-C, followed by a comprehensive characterization of HRV-C infection and innate immunity in physiologically active respiratory organoids. The organoid-based HRV-C infection model can be extended for developing antiviral strategies. More importantly, our study has opened an avenue for propagating and studying other uncultivable human and animal viruses.

abstract: This study aims to mine and analyze adverse events (AEs) of Vedolizumab based on the FAERS database to better understand its safety and potential risks in the real world. Data from the second quarter of 2014 to the third quarter of 2023 were collected, employing various signal mining methods such as Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM). The study gathered 14,753,012 reports of AEs, of which 46,726 were related to Vedolizumab. Signal mining identified 401 Preferred Terms (PTs) involving 27 System Organ Classes (SOCs). There was an increasing trend in the number of reports, with a slightly higher proportion of reports from women compared to men, and the primary reporting group was adults, especially those aged between 18 and 65 years. New potential AE signals were identified, such as a higher incidence of Pregnancy, Haematochezia, and Clostridium difficile infection. Although less frequent, strong signals were noted for Incisional hernia, Intestinal fistula infection, Anastomotic complication, Drug metabolising enzyme increased, Gingival graft, Intestinal anastomosis complication, Anorectal infection, Perineal rash, and Abdominal hernia obstructive. Despite the positive prospects of Vedolizumab in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, the AEs related to its use identified in this study, particularly the newly identified potential risks, suggest that even targeted therapies can have systemic effects beyond expectations.

abstract: The forces generated by action potentials in muscle cells shuttle blood, food and waste products throughout the luminal structures of the body. Although non-invasive electrophysiological techniques exist1-3, most mechanosensors cannot access luminal structures non-invasively4-6. Here we introduce non-toxic ingestible mechanosensors to enable the quantitative study of luminal forces and apply them to study feeding in living Caenorhabditis elegans roundworms. These optical 'microgauges' comprise upconverting NaY0.8Yb0.18Er0.02F4@NaYF4 nanoparticles embedded in polystyrene microspheres. Combining optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy to study microgauges in vitro, we show that force evokes a linear and hysteresis-free change in the ratio of emitted red to green light. With fluorescence imaging and non-invasive electrophysiology, we show that adult C. elegans generate bite forces during feeding on the order of 10 µN and that the temporal pattern of force generation is aligned with muscle activity in the feeding organ. Moreover, the bite force we measure corresponds to Hertzian contact stresses in the pressure range used to lyse the bacterial food of the worm7,8. Microgauges have the potential to enable quantitative studies that investigate how neuromuscular stresses are affected by ageing, genetic mutations and drug treatments in this organ and other luminal organs.

abstract: The effect of immunotherapy for colorectal cancer (CRC) is limited due to anti-tumor immunosuppression. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are also associated with tumor immunity. The aim of this study was to clarify the regulatory relationship between circRNA and anti-tumor immunosuppression in CRC. CircRNAs associated with CRC were identified using bioinformatic analysis and subsequently confirmed in clinical samples using qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization. The expression, clinical relevance, functional significance and clinical properties of circMVP in CRC specimens and cells were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RNA pull-down, single-cell RNA sequencing, EMSA, RNA immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and polysome profiling assay were performed to confirm the underlying mechanism of circRNA. CircMVP (hsa_circ_0000688) expression was increased in CRC and correlated with poor prognosis in CRC patients. Increased circMVP expression activates proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis of CRC. In addition, we found that circMVP, by interacting with METTL3, stabilizes its expression in the nucleus and significantly enhances its mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification. Specifically, circMVP/METTL3 promoted the expression of β-catenin by directly acting on CTNNB1 mRNA. CircMVP/METTL3 further enhanced the expression of B7-H3 through the β-catenin signaling pathway. Notably, inhibition of circMVP expression significantly improved the efficacy of anti-B7-H3 immunotherapy in in vivo and in vitro models. CircMVP mediated CTNNB1 m6A modification by promoting METTL3 activation and inhibited B7-H3-dependent anti-tumor immune response in CRC. In conclusion, circMVP may be a predictor of CRC immune evasion and a potential therapeutic target.

abstract: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune, chronic, systemic inflammatory disease that causes redness, swelling, stiffness, and joint pain. It is a long-lasting disease that can have a widespread impact on the body, often affecting the hands, feet, and wrists. The immune cells, such as dendritic cells, T cells, B cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, play a significant role in bone degradation and inflammation. Several cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-17A, play a significant role in causing bone erosion, cartilage deterioration, and joint inflammation. Progesterone and estrogen have a crucial impact on the pathophysiology of RA, influencing the immune system. Research has demonstrated that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can effectively reduce inflammation, improve disease activity, enhance joint health, alleviate pain, and promote bone strength. Treatments such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, known as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), are effective against chronic inflammatory illnesses like RA. The treatment with Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) has an impact on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which in turn affects the activity of RA illness. These alternative treatments hold promise in enhancing well-being and alleviating joint pain for individuals with RA.

abstract: Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a ROCO family member which its mutation is closely related with Parkinson's disease, and LRRK2 is widely involved into the regulation of autophagy, vesicle transport and neuronal proliferation. However, the roles of LRRK2 during mammalian oocyte maturation are still largely unclear. In present study, we disturbed the activity of LRRK2 and showed its essential roles in porcine oocytes. We showed that LRRK2 stably expressed during oocyte maturation, and the loss of LRRK2 activity disturbed cumulus expansion and oocyte polar body extrusion, indicating its involvement into oocyte maturation. Further analysis indicated that LRRK2 was related with cytoskeleton dynamics since its inhibition caused spindle organization defect and chromosome misalignment, and both cytoplasmic and cortex actin decreased. Moreover, LRRK2 co-localized with mitochondria and its activity was essential for mitochondria distribution. Loss of LRRK2 activity altered the TMRE level, which ultimately induced ROS-related oxidative stress. Taken together, our data suggested the important roles of LRRK2 on mammalian oocyte maturation through its effects on cytoskeleton dynamics and mitochondria functions.

abstract: Delandistrogene moxeparvovec is an rAAVrh74 vector-based gene transfer therapy that delivers a transgene encoding delandistrogene moxeparvovec micro-dystrophin, an engineered, functional form of dystrophin shown to stabilize or slow disease progression in DMD. It is approved in the US and in other select countries. Two serious adverse event cases of immune-mediated myositis (IMM) were reported in the phase Ib ENDEAVOR trial (NCT04626674). We hypothesized that immune responses to the micro-dystrophin transgene product may have mediated these IMM events. An interferon-gamma ELISpot assay was used to detect T cell responses to delandistrogene moxeparvovec micro-dystrophin peptide pools. ELISpot analysis suggested that IMM resulted from T cell-mediated responses directed against specific micro-dystrophin peptides corresponding to exons 8 and 9 (Case 1) and exon 8 (Case 2) of the DMD gene. In silico epitope mapping based on the patients' HLA-I alleles indicated greater probability for peptides derived from exons 8 and/or 9 to bind HLA-I, providing further evidence that peptides derived from corresponding micro-dystrophin regions may have higher immunogenic potential. Collectively, these data suggest that patients with DMD gene deletions involving exons 8 and/or 9 may be at increased risk of IMM following delandistrogene moxeparvovec micro-dystrophin gene therapy infusion.

abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound vesicles that are shed or secreted from the cell membrane and enveloped by a lipid bilayer. They possess stability, low immunogenicity, and non-cytotoxicity, exhibiting extensive prospects in regenerative medicine (RM). However, natural EVs pose challenges, such as insufficient targeting capabilities, potential biosafety concerns, and limited acquisition pathways. Although engineered EVs demonstrate excellent therapeutic efficacy, challenges such as low production yield and the complexity of engineering modifications constrain their further clinical applications. Bacteria have advantages such as rapid proliferation, diverse gene editing methods, mature cultivation techniques, and relatively easy preparation of bacterial EVs (BEVs), which can be used to effectively address the challenges currently encountered in the field of EVs. This review provides a description of the biogenesis and pathophysiological functions of BEVs, and strategies for optimizing BEVs preparation to attain efficiency and safety are discussed. An analysis of natural characteristics of BEVs is also conducted to explore how to leverage their advantages or mitigate their limitations, thereby overcoming constraints on the application of BEVs in RM. In summary, engineered BEVs possess characteristics such as high production yield, excellent stability, and high drug-delivering capabilities, laying the foundation for their application in RM.

abstract: Microglia, as resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS), play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and phagocytosing metabolic waste in the brain. Senescent microglia exhibit decreased phagocytic capacity and increased neuroinflammation through senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This process contributes to the development of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we found that SASP was elevated in senescent microglia, and proteomics showed that Tgm2 was upregulated. Mechanistically, we revealed that Tgm2-catalyzed covalent cross-linking of IκBα at K22 and Q248 residues in the cytoplasm of microglia, resulting in the reduction of IκBα and nuclear translocation of NF-κB to promote SASP production. Treatment of senescent microglia with Tgm2 inhibitors (Tg2-IN1 and Cys-D) resulted in reduced NF-κB nuclear translocation and decreased SASP. Additionally, oral administration of Cys-D significantly improved the aging phenotype in aged mice. To summarize, Tgm2 is a potential target for antiaging, and inhibitors of Tgm2 can serve as novel prophylactics or senomorphics.

abstract: Different forms of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) have shown strong potential as Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. We hypothesized that p-tau proteoforms simultaneously phosphorylated at two different sites may have an increased diagnostic value compared with tau phosphorylated at a single site. Here, we developed two immunoassays detecting CSF and plasma tau simultaneously phosphorylated at both T181 and T231 (p-tau181&231) and at T217 and T231 (p-tau217&231). Subsequently, we measured CSF and plasma p-tau181&231, p-tau217&231, p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231 levels in two cohorts across the AD continuum and in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients (discovery n = 55, validation n = 118). CSF and plasma p-tau217&231, p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231 and CSF, but not plasma, p-tau181&231 were significantly elevated in all AD continuum groups vs. Neurological Disease Control group. Notably, plasma p-tau217&231 consistently showed an improved diagnostic performance compared with single-site phosphorylation assays - p-tau217 or p-tau231. The differences observed between CSF and plasma measurements suggest matrix-specific protein processing, underscoring the need for further research on the dynamics of tau phosphorylation pattern along the AD continuum.

abstract: Conventional chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced cancer senescence, which is characterized by poor proliferation, drug resistance, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype, has gained attention as contributing to cancer relapse and the development of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, the association between cancer senescence and anti-tumor immunity is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that senescent cancer cells increase the level of PD-L1 by promoting its transcription and glycosylation. We identify ribophorin 1 as a key regulator of PD-L1 glycosylation during cancer senescence. Ribophorin 1 depletion reduces this elevated level of PD-L1 through the ER-lysosome-associated degradation pathway, thereby increasing the susceptibility of senescent cancer cells to T-cell-mediated killing. Consistently, ribophorin 1 depletion suppresses tumor growth by decreasing PD-L1 levels and boosting cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity in male mice. Moreover, ribophorin 1-targeted or anti-PD-1 therapy reduces the number of senescent cancer cells in irradiated tumors and suppresses cancer recurrence through the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These results provide crucial insights into how senescent cancer cells can escape T-cell immunity following cancer treatment and thereby contribute to cancer recurrence. Our findings also highlight the therapeutic promise of targeting senescent cancer cells for cancer treatment.

abstract: Developing a new diagnostic prediction model for osteoarthritis (OA) to assess the likelihood of individuals developing OA is crucial for the timely identification of potential populations of OA. This allows for further diagnosis and intervention, which is significant for improving patient prognosis. Based on the NHANES for the periods of 2011-2012, 2013-2014, and 2015-2016, the study involved 11,366 participants, of whom 1,434 reported a diagnosis of OA. LASSO regression, XGBoost algorithm, and RF algorithm were used to identify significant indicators, and a OA prediction nomogram was developed. The nomogram was evaluated by measuring the AUC, calibration curve, and DCA curve of training and validation sets. In this study, we identified 5 predictors from 19 variables, including age, gender, hypertension, BMI and caffeine intake, and developed an OA nomogram. In both the training and validation cohorts, the OA nomogram exhibited good diagnostic predictive performance (with AUCs of 0.804 and 0.814, respectively), good consistency and stability in calibration curve and high net benefit in DCA. The nomogram based on 5 variables demonstrates a high accuracy in predicting the diagnosis of OA, indicating that it is a convenient tool for clinicians to identify potential populations of OA.

abstract: Identifying gene expression differences in heterogeneous tissues across conditions is a fundamental biological task, enabled by multi-condition single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Current data analysis approaches divide the constituent cells into clusters meant to represent cell types, but such discrete categorization tends to be an unsatisfactory model of the underlying biology. Here, we introduce latent embedding multivariate regression (LEMUR), a model that operates without, or before, commitment to discrete categorization. LEMUR (1) integrates data from different conditions, (2) predicts each cell's gene expression changes as a function of the conditions and its position in latent space and (3) for each gene, identifies a compact neighborhood of cells with consistent differential expression. We apply LEMUR to cancer, zebrafish development and spatial gradients in Alzheimer's disease, demonstrating its broad applicability.

abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), decreases quality of life and causes disability. The underlying processes are not fully understood. This study uses Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to identify cytokines that may be associated with UC and CD, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment decisions. Methods Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for inflammatory cytokine levels were obtained from a cohort of 14,824 individuals of European descent. The outcome data were then analyzed using summary-level GWAS data for UC and CD from the International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC). The analysis was primarily conducted using inverse-variance weighted (IVW) methods, with MR-Egger and weighted median serving as supplementary analyses. Sensitivity analyses included Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, MR-PRESSO, and leave-one-out analysis.The inflammatory cytokines were subjected to additional scrutiny through the application of the Steiger test and reverse Mendelian randomization analysis. Subsequently, multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) was employed to examine the associations of metabolites on UC and CD, in conjunction with linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and colocalization analysis. After FDR correction, we identified significant genetic associations of two inflammatory proteins (CXCL5 and CXCL9) with UC, and CXCL5 and IL-18R1 with CD. These findings were further validated by MVMR. Colocalization analyses demonstrated substantial genetic overlap between inflammatory proteins and IBD, with CXCL5 showing strong evidence of shared genetic variants with UC, and CXCL9 exhibiting genetic colocalization with CD, suggesting common genetic determinants underlying these inflammatory protein-IBD relationships. The current work presents evidence that presents evidence of significant associations between seven inflammatory protein factors and UC, as well as three inflammatory protein factors and CD. These findings provide novel insights into the biological mechanisms of IBD, and have implications for the screening, prevention, and treatment of IBD.

Although the NSN-SN transition is known to be essential for developmental competence of the oocyte, less is known about the accompanying molecular changes. Here we examine the changes in the transcriptome and DNA methylation during the NSN to SN transition in mouse oocytes.

abstract: The triglyceride glucose (TyG) index-related obesity indices have been proposed as reliable indicators of insulin resistance. This study aims to investigate the association between TyG index-related obesity indices and sarcopenia as well as their potential as a tool for screening sarcopenic patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 7,161 participants aged 18 and above from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. TyG index and TyG index-related obesity indices, including triglyceride glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI), triglyceride glucose-waist circumference (TyG-WC), and triglyceride glucose-waist-to-height ratio (TyG-WHtR) were determined using standard formulas. The ratio of appendicular skeletal muscle mass to BMI were used to assess sarcopenia. The relationship between the TyG index as well as TyG index-related obesity indices and sarcopenia was investigated using restricted cubic spline analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis. The diagnostic value of the TyG index and TyG index -related obesity indices for sarcopenia was compared using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. In the fully adjusted regression model, a positive correlation was observed between the TyG-WHtR index and sarcopenia (for each one-unit increase in TyG-WHtR index: OR = 3.57, 95% CI: 2.71-4.71, P < 0.001). Additionally, regression analyses demonstrated TyG-WHtR as a significant predictor of sarcopenia with the highest odds ratio, reaching 12.50 (95% CI: 6.13-25.70, P < 0.001) for the upper fourth quartile (Q4) compared to the first quartile, followed by followed by TyG-BMI (Q4: 3.34; 95% CI: 1.92-5.80, P < 0.001) and TyG-WC (Q4: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.04-3.68, P < 0.001). The RCS curve fitting analysis indicated a U-shaped relationship between TyG-WHtR and the diagnosis of sarcopenia, with an inflection point at 4.02. Furthermore, in the ROC analysis, the AUC for the diagnosis of sarcopenia was largest for TyG-WHtR (0.79, P < 0.001). The TyG ndex-related obesity indices, especially TyG-WHtR, have been shown to be more effective in identifying sarcopenia patients than TyG alone.

abstract: Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality, contributing to both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular deaths. The Body Roundness Index (BRI) and Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII) have emerged as predictors of adverse outcomes in metabolic diseases. This study investigates the association between BRI, SII, and mortality risk in MAFLD patients. A nationwide retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the NHANES database (January 1999-December 2018), including patients diagnosed with MAFLD. BRI and SII were calculated at baseline. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the association between these indices and all-cause, cardiovascular, and non-cardiovascular mortality, adjusting for confounders. Among 12,435 participants diagnosed with MAFLD, 3,381 (27.2%) were classified into the low BRI and low SII group, 2,889 (23.2%) into the low BRI and high SII group, 2,802 (22.5%) into the high BRI and low SII group, and 3,363 (27.1%) into the high BRI and high SII group. Compared to the low BRI and low SII group, the high BRI and high SII group demonstrated significantly higher all-cause mortality, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.89. For cardiovascular mortality, the HR was 2.31, while for non-cardiovascular mortality, the HR was 1.78. The high BRI and high SII cohort exhibited the highest risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and non-cardiovascular mortality. BRI and SII are independent predictors of mortality in MAFLD patients, and their combined use enhances risk stratification. Integrating these indices into clinical practice could improve personalized management strategies and outcomes in this high-risk population.

abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with a dismal prognosis, primarily due to its high rates of metastasis and recurrence. Metabolic reprogramming, specifically enhanced glycolysis, is a prominent feature of cancer progression. This study identifies ubiquitin-specific peptidase 27 X-linked (USP27) as a significant regulator of glycolysis in HCC. We demonstrate that USP27 stabilizes PFKFB3, a key glycolytic enzyme, through deubiquitination, thereby increasing glycolytic activity and facilitating tumor progression. Furthermore, we reveal that CTCF, a well-known transcription factor, directly binds to the USP27 promoter and upregulates its expression, thereby establishing a connection between transcriptional regulation and metabolic reprogramming in HCC. Knockdown of USP27 or CTCF in HCC cells considerably decreased glycolysis and proliferation, while overexpression had the opposite effect. In vivo studies confirmed that USP27 knockdown suppresses HCC growth and metastasis. Our findings establish the CTCF/USP27/PFKFB3 axis as a novel mechanism driving HCC progression through glycolysis, indicating that targeting this pathway could offer new therapeutic opportunities. These results provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC and emphasize the potential of targeting USP27-mediated metabolic pathways as a strategy for cancer treatment.

abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive disease with a high relapse rate. In this study, we map the metabolic profile of CD34+(CD38low/-) AML cells and the extracellular vesicle signatures in circulation from AML patients at diagnosis. CD34+ AML cells display high antioxidant glutathione levels and enhanced mitochondrial functionality, both associated with poor clinical outcomes. Although CD34+ AML cells are highly dependent on glucose oxidation and glycolysis for energy, those from intermediate- and adverse-risk patients reveal increased mitochondrial dependence. Extracellular vesicles from AML are mainly enriched in stem cell markers and express antioxidant GPX3, with their profiles showing potential prognostic value. Extracellular vesicles enhance mitochondrial functionality and dependence on CD34+ AML cells via the glutathione/GPX4 axis. Notably, extracellular vesicles from adverse-risk patients enhance leukemia cell engraftment in vivo. Here, we show a potential noninvasive approach based on liquid 'cell-extracellular vesicle' biopsy toward a redefined metabolic stratification in AML.

abstract: Ion channels, as functional molecules that regulate the flow of ions across cell membranes, have emerged as a promising target in cancer therapy due to their pivotal roles in cell proliferation, metastasis, apoptosis, drug resistance, and so on. Recently, increasing evidence suggests that dysregulation of ion channels is a common characteristic of cancer cells, contributing to their survival and the resistance to conventional therapies. For example, the aberrant expression of sodium (Na+) and potassium ion (K+) channels is significantly correlated with the sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs. The endogenous calcium (Ca2+) channels contribute to the acquired resistance of osimertinib in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. Ferrous ions (Fe2+) enhance the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to doxorubicin treatment. Preclinical models have also demonstrated the effect of specific ion channel blockers or modulators on anticancer drug resistance. This review describes the current understanding about the interaction between ion channels and the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs. Then, the therapeutic potential of ion channel blockers or modulators in enhancing the sensitivity or overcoming the resistance of cancer cells to anticancer therapies is discussed. Targeting ion channels will hopefully offer a novel and promising strategy for overcoming cancer drug resistance.

abstract: Organoids, self-organized structures derived from stem cells cultured in a specific three-dimensional (3D) in vitro microenvironment, have emerged as innovative platforms that closely mimic in vivo cellular behavior, tissue architecture, and organ function. Bone organoids, a frontier in organoid research, can replicate the complex structures and functional characteristics of bone tissue. Recent advancements have led to the successful development of bone organoids, including models of callus, woven bone, cartilage, trabecular bone, and bone marrow. These organoids are widely utilized in establishing bone-related disease models, bone injury repair, and drug screening. However, significant discrepancies remain between current bone organoids and human skeletal tissues in terms of morphology and functionality, limiting their ability to accurately model human bone physiology and pathology. To address these challenges and promote standardization in the construction, evaluation, and application of bone organoids, we have convened experts and research teams with substantial expertise in the field. By integrating existing research findings, this consortium aims to establish a consensus to guide future research and application of bone organoids.

abstract: After ending the three-year zero COVID policy in China, the epidemiology of other respiratory pathogens has been affected. This study aimed to characterize of common respiratory pathogen infections in pediatric patients hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in Suzhou before and after ending the zero COVID policy. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were obtained from children with ARTIs (aged ≤ 16 years) at the Children's Hospital of Soochow University for the detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A (FluA), FluB, human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), adenovirus (ADV), human rhinovirus (HRV), bocavirus (BoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP). The data were compared between two periods: January 2020 to December 2022 (before ending the zero COVID policy) and January 2023 to May 2024 (after ending the zero COVID policy). Patients were divided into four groups: 0-2, ≥ 3-5, ≥ 6-10, and ≥ 11-16 years. A total of 42,379 patients were enrolled and the top four pathogens identified were MP, HRV, RSV and HPIV with positive rates of 20.2%, 19.5%, 15.1%, and 6.9%, respectively. A total of 28,352 positive cases were detected, with positive rates of 54.0% (n = 11,850/21,941) and 80.7% (n = 16,502/20,438) before and after ending the zero COVID policy, respectively. Total RSV, HRV, HPIV, and MP positivity increased by 27.8%, 39.0%, 12.3%, and 322.7%, respectively, after ending the zero COVID policy compared to positivity before the policy. After ending the zero COVID policy, the positive rates of RSV, HRV, and HPIV increased most in children aged 0-2 years, with increases by 88.8% (OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 2.2-2.5), 50.0% (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.5-1.7), and 69.6% (OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.6-2.0), respectively. The greatest increase in MP positivity was 316.9% in the 3-5 years (OR: 5.5, 95% CI: 4.9-6.1). After ending the zero COVID policy, the RSV-positive rate increased most in summer, while HRV was predominantly circulated in spring and the MP-positive rate peaked in autumn. Ending the zero COVID policy facilitated the transmission of common respiratory pathogens in children. Post-pandemic surveillance and control of respiratory pathogens must be strengthened to reduce health risks.

abstract: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) remains a major threat to animal health and causes substantial economic losses worldwide. The nonstructural protein 11 (NSP11) of the causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), contains a highly conserved nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) domain essential for viral replication and immune evasion. Targeting NSP11 offers a novel approach to antiviral intervention. Through in silico virtual screening followed by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay , we identified A8-A2 as a promising candidate that effectively inhibits NendoU activity. Molecular docking and mutational analysis revealed that A8-A2 and its analogs target the key catalytic residues His144 and Thr217 of NSP11, located within the NendoU enzyme activity loop and pocket region, respectively. A8-A2 demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of PRRSV replication in porcine alveolar macrophages. Notably, the NendoU is conserved across PRRSV strains and other Nidoviruses, and A8-A2 exhibited antiviral activity against both type I and type II PRRSV strains, as well as the infectious bronchitis virus, a coronavirus in the order Nidovirales. Further investigations revealed that A8-A2 impedes viral replication early in infection and reverses NSP11-mediated suppression of Poly(I:C)-induced interferon production. However, this effect occurs independently of mRNA splicing inhibition. These findings indicate that A8-A2 could act as an effective antiviral agent against infections caused by diverse PRRSV strains and may serve as a broad-spectrum agent for other Nidoviruses.

abstract: Although immune checkpoint inhibitors have changed the treatment paradigm for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), not all patients benefit from them. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore novel immune checkpoint inhibitors. Neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1) is a unique immune checkpoint capable of exerting antitumor effects through CD8+ T cells. It is also a T-cell memory checkpoint that regulates long-term antitumor immunity. However, its role in NSCLC remains unclear. The aim of this study was to develop a fully human anti-Nrp-1 antibody with therapeutic effects against NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. We screened and constructed of a high-affinity anti-Nrp-1 IgG antibody from a constructed high-capacity fully human single-chain fragment variable (scFv) phage library. This novel anti-Nrp-1 IgG antibody partially restored the killing function of exhausted CD8+ T cells in malignant pleural fluid in vitro. Co-culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with A549 and the addition of anti-Nrp1-IgG enhanced the killing of A549 target cells, leading to an increase in late-stage apoptosis of target cells. Importantly, anti-Nrp1-IgG treatment significantly reduced tumor volume in a mouse model of lung cancer with humanized immune system. These findings suggest that 53-IgG has a promising application as a potent Nrp-1-targeting agent in NSCLC immunotherapy.

abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest family of membrane receptors and are highly effective targets for therapeutic drugs. GPCRs couple different downstream effectors, including G proteins (such as Gi/o, Gs, G12, and Gq) and β-arrestins (such as β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2) to mediate diverse cellular and physiological responses. Biased signaling allows for the specific activation of certain pathways from the full range of receptors' signaling capabilities. Targeting more variable allosteric sites, which are spatially different from the highly conserved orthosteric sites, represents a novel approach in biased GPCR drug discovery, leading to innovative strategies for targeting GPCRs. Notably, the emergence of cryptic allosteric sites on GPCRs has expanded the repertoire of available drug targets and improved receptor subtype selectivity. Here, we conduct a summary of recent progress in the structural determination of cryptic allosteric sites on GPCRs and elucidate the biased signaling mechanisms induced by allosteric modulators. Additionally, we discuss means to identify cryptic allosteric sites and design biased allosteric modulators based on cryptic allosteric sites through structure-based drug design, which is an advanced pharmacotherapeutic approach for treating GPCR-associated diseases.

abstract: At the 2023 Global Vaccine and Immunization Research Forum (GVIRF), researchers from around the world gathered in the Republic of Korea to discuss advances and opportunities in vaccines and immunization. Many stakeholders are applying the lessons of Covid-19 to future emergencies, by advancing early-stage development of prototype vaccines to accelerate response to the next emerging infectious disease, and by building regional vaccine research, development, and manufacturing capacity to speed equitable access to vaccines in the next emergency. Recent vaccine licensures include: respiratory syncytial virus vaccines, both for the elderly and to protect infants through maternal immunization; a new dengue virus vaccine; and licensure of Covid-19 vaccines previously marketed under emergency use authorizations. Malaria vaccine implementation is expanding and a second malaria vaccine has been recommended by the World Health Organization. In a setback for human immunodeficiency virus vaccine development, the only remaining Phase 3 trial has been discontinued. In immunization, greater clarity is emerging on the challenges of achieving access and equity, along with strategies to address those challenges. A better understanding of behavioral and social determinants of vaccine uptake and a validated toolkit for measuring and modifying the drivers of vaccination is informing program design and service delivery, contributing to improved uptake. Implementation research, which has been essential for human papillomavirus and malaria vaccine delivery, will be critical for delivering the new respiratory syncytial virus vaccines and for many other vaccines currently in development. The growing diversity of vaccines and complexity of immunization programs are leading to greater interest in simplified regimens, combination vaccines, and other innovations to facilitate delivery. Collaboration emerged as the unifying theme of GVIRF 2023, underscoring that the combined efforts of many contributors have enabled progress thus far, and going forward will continue to be essential to ensure equitable access to vaccines for all.

abstract: Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Although with current treatment, acute mortality from MI is low, the damage and remodeling associated with MI are responsible for subsequent heart failure. Reducing cell death associated with acute MI would decrease the mortality associated with heart failure. Despite considerable study, the precise mechanism by which ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) trigger cell death is still not fully understood. In this Review, we summarize the changes that occur during I/R injury, with emphasis on those that might initiate cell death, such as calcium overload and oxidative stress. We review cell-death pathways and pathway crosstalk and discuss cardioprotective approaches in order to provide insight into mechanisms that could be targeted with therapeutic interventions. Finally, we review cardioprotective clinical trials, with a focus on possible reasons why they were not successful. Cardioprotection has largely focused on inhibiting a single cell-death pathway or one death-trigger mechanism (calcium or ROS). In treatment of other diseases, such as cancer, the benefit of targeting multiple pathways with a "drug cocktail" approach has been demonstrated. Given the crosstalk between cell-death pathways, targeting multiple cardiac death mechanisms should be considered.

Here we engineered an orthogonal alphaviral RNA replication system to evolve RNA-based devices, enabling RNA replicase-assisted continuous evolution (REPLACE) in proliferating mammalian cells. This system generates a large, continuously diversified library of replicative RNAs through replicase-limited mode of replication and inducible mutagenesis. Using REPLACE, we engineered fluorescent proteins and transcription factors. Notably, cells equipped with REPLACE can undergo Darwinian adaptation, allowing them to evolve in response to both cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic challenges. Collectively, this work establishes a powerful platform for advancing mammalian synthetic biology and cell engineering applications through directed evolution.

abstract: Introduction:
        
      
      Aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau (tauopathy) is associated with cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, a metabolic shift due to the Warburg effect results in increased lactate production. Lactate can induce a post-translational modification (PTM) on proteins that conjugates lactyl groups to lysine (K) residues, which is known as lactylation.

abstract: Immunotherapy has revolutionised the treatment landscape of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), significantly improving survival outcomes and offering renewed hope to patients with advanced disease. However, the majority of patients experience limited long-term benefits from immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) due to the development of primary or acquired immunotherapy resistance. Accurate predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy resistance are essential for individualising treatment strategies, improving survival outcomes, and minimising potential treatment-related harm. This review discusses the mechanisms underlying resistance to immunotherapy, addressing both cancer cell-intrinsic and cancer cell-extrinsic resistance processes. We summarise the current utility and limitations of two clinically established biomarkers: programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and tumour mutational burden (TMB). Following this, we present a comprehensive review of emerging immunotherapy biomarkers in NSCLC, including tumour neoantigens, epigenetic signatures, markers of the tumour microenvironment (TME), genomic alterations, host-microbiome composition, and circulating biomarkers. The potential clinical applications of these biomarkers, along with novel approaches to their biomarker identification and targeting, are discussed. Additionally, we explore current strategies to overcome immunotherapy resistance and propose incorporating predictive biomarkers into an adaptive clinical trial design, where specific immune signatures guide subsequent treatment selection.

abstract: Wound healing is vital for human health, yet the details of cellular dynamics and coordination in human wound repair remain largely unexplored. To address this, we conducted single-cell multi-omics analyses on human skin wound tissues through inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling phases of wound repair from the same individuals, monitoring the cellular and molecular dynamics of human skin wound healing at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. This singular roadmap reveals the cellular architecture of the wound margin and identifies FOSL1 as a critical driver of re-epithelialization. It shows that pro-inflammatory macrophages and fibroblasts sequentially support keratinocyte migration like a relay race across different healing stages. Comparison with single-cell data from venous and diabetic foot ulcers uncovers a link between failed keratinocyte migration and impaired inflammatory response in chronic wounds. Additionally, comparing human and mouse acute wound transcriptomes underscores the indispensable value of this roadmap in bridging basic research with clinical innovations.

abstract: Profiling tumors with single-cell RNA sequencing has the potential to identify recurrent patterns of transcription variation related to cancer progression, and to produce therapeutically relevant insights. However, strong intertumor heterogeneity can obscure more subtle patterns that are shared across tumors. Here we introduce a statistical method, generalized binary covariance decomposition (GBCD), to address this problem. We show that GBCD can decompose transcriptional heterogeneity into interpretable components-including patient-specific, dataset-specific and shared components relevant to disease subtypes-and that, in the presence of strong intertumor heterogeneity, it can produce more interpretable results than existing methods. Applied to data on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, GBCD produced a refined characterization of existing tumor subtypes, and identified a gene expression program prognostic of poor survival independent of tumor stage and subtype. The gene expression program is enriched for genes involved in stress responses, and suggests a role for the integrated stress response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

abstract: Modern sugarcane, a highly allo-autopolyploid organism, has a very complex genome. In the present study, the karyotype and genome architecture of modern sugarcane were investigated, resulting in a genome assembly of 97 chromosomes (8.84 Gb). The allopolyploid genome was divided into subgenomes from Saccharum officinarum (Soh) and S. spontaneum (Ssh), with Soh dominance in the Saccharum hybrid (S. hybrid). Genome shock affected transcriptome dynamics during allopolyploidization. Analysis of an inbreeding population with 192 individuals revealed the underlying genetic basis of transgressive segregation. Population genomics of 310 Saccharum accessions clarified the breeding history of modern sugarcane. Using the haplotype-resolved S. hybrid genome as a reference, genome-wide association studies identified a potential candidate gene for sugar content from S. spontaneum. These findings illuminate the complex genome evolution of allopolyploids, offering opportunities for genomic enhancements and innovative breeding strategies for sugarcane.

abstract: Chronic low-grade inflammation observed in older adults, termed inflammaging, is a common feature underlying a multitude of aging-associated maladies including a decline in hematopoietic activity. However, whether suppression of inflammaging can preserve hematopoietic health span remains unclear, in part because of a lack of tools to measure inflammaging within hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here, we identify thrombospondin-1 (Thbs1) as an essential regulator of inflammaging within HSCs. We describe a transcriptomics-based approach for measuring inflammaging within stem cells and demonstrate that deletion of Thbs1 is sufficient to prevent HSC inflammaging. Our results demonstrate that suppression of HSC inflammaging prevents aging-associated defects in hematopoietic activity including loss of HSC self-renewal, myeloid-biased HSC differentiation, and anemia. Our findings indicate that suppression of HSC inflammaging may also prolong overall systemic health span.

abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease characterized by cartilage degeneration. It can cause severe pain, deformity and even amputation risk. However, existing clinical treatment methods for cartilage repair present certain deficiencies. Meanwhile, the repair effect of cartilage tissue engineering is also unsatisfactory. Cartilage organoids are multicellular aggregates with cartilage-like three-dimensional structure and function. On the one hand, cartilage organoids can be used to explore the pathogenesis of OA by constructing disease models. On the other hand, it can be used as filler for rapid cartilage repair. Extracellular matrix (ECM)-like three-dimensional environment is the key to construct cartilage organoids. Silk fibroin (SF)-based hydrogels not only have ECM-like structure, but also have unique mechanical properties and remarkable biocompatibility. Therefore, SF-based hydrogels are considered as ideal biomaterials for constructing cartilage organoids. In this review, we reviewed the studies of cartilage organoids and SF-based hydrogels. The advantages of SF-based hydrogels in constructing cartilage organoids and the iterative optimization of cartilage organoids through designing hydrogels by using artificial intelligence (AI) calculation are also discussed. This review aims to provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of OA using SF-based biomaterials and cartilage organoids.

abstract: Depression is a prevalent public health issue, characterized by persistent low mood, impaired concentration, and diminished motivation. Photobiomodulation (PBM), which involves the application of red or near-infrared light, modulates physiological processes by enhancing cerebral blood flow, reducing inflammation, inhibiting apoptosis, and promoting neurogenesis. PBM can be administered transcranially or through systemic approaches, offering a potentially effective intervention for depression. This review discusses the characteristics of PBM, its underlying neurobiological mechanisms, and relevant physical parameters. Recent progress in both animal and clinical research underscores PBM's therapeutic potential for depression and emphasizes the need for further studies to establish a robust theoretical basis for standardized treatment protocols.

abstract: Benign paroxysmal vertigo (BPV) is a common cause of dizziness, and some patients are comorbid with psychiatric disorders such as depression, requiring intervention with antidepressants. However, the causal association between BPV, depression and antidepressants has not been clearly established. We used two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to analyze the causal association between BPV, depression, and antidepressants. From a Finnish database, 43,280 patients with depression and 329,192 controls, and 106,785 patients with antidepressants and 88,536 controls were selected. Independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for depression and antidepressants were used as instrumental variables (IVs) with genomic significance (p < 5 × 10-8). Similarly, genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for BPV were selected from a Finnish database consisting of 8280 cases and 359,094 controls. Afterwards, a two-sample MR study was performed using R's Two Sample MR and MR-PRESSO software packages. The multiplicity and heterogeneity of the data, as well as the effect of individual SNPs on the results were investigated. The main statistical analyses were weighted median, weighted mode, MR-Egger and weighted inverse variance weighting (IVW) for random effects. Finally, we identified associations between BPV, antidepressants and depression. Four outliers (rs3773087, rs4619804, rs62099231, rs7192848) were found to be associated with depression. After removing the outliers, the statistics showed no heterogeneity (p > 0.05) and horizontal pleiotropy (p > 0.05). Antidepressants were also found to have a random effect IVW (β = 0.440; p = 9.692 × 10-6; OR = 1.553; 95% CI 1.278-1.887). The inverse MR random effects IVW results showed a causal association between BPV and antidepressants (β = 0.051; p = 0.045; OR = 1.052; 95% CI 1.001-1.1066). In conclusion, there was a significant causal association between antidepressants and BPV at the genetic level. Clinicians should pay attention to patients with BPV combined with depressive disorders and develop timely interventions.

abstract: Despite significant advances in HIV treatment, a definitive cure remains elusive. The first-in-human clinical trial of Excision BioTherapeutics' CRISPR-based HIV cure, EBT-101, demonstrated safety but failed to prevent viral rebound. These outcomes may result from the interplay of several factors. Growing evidence indicates that intricate epigenetic modifications play a major role in the persistence of HIV latency, presenting a significant barrier to eradication efforts and causing viral rebound after ART discontinuation. Current strategies to purge the latent reservoir involve LRAs that reactivate latent proviruses. However, their clinical success is hindered by the heterogeneity of HIV reservoirs and the virus's diverse pathways. Additionally, RNA modifications like N6-methyladenosine (m^6 A) methylation influence HIV biology beyond transcriptional control, affect RNA stability, splicing, and translation, which could enhance therapeutic efficacy. The regulatory framework of chromatin dynamics is also key to understanding viral latency and reactivation, such as Vpr's role in reactivating latent HIV by targeting HDACs. Sex-specific factors were also shown to play an important role with females, showing stronger early immune responses and higher representation among elite controllers. This review addresses the multifaceted challenges of HIV cure research, focusing on genetic diversity, epigenetic regulation, RNA modifications, chromatin remodeling, and sex-specific factors. By integrating insights into these aspects, this paper aims to advance our understanding of HIV cure strategies and highlight directions for future research.

abstract: We have identified FLT1 as a protein that changes during Alzheimer's disease (AD) whereby higher brain protein levels are associated with more amyloid, more tau, and faster longitudinal cognitive decline. Given FLT1's role in angiogenesis and immune activation, we hypothesized that FLT1 is upregulated in response to amyloid pathology, driving a vascular-immune cascade resulting in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. We sought to determine (1) if in vivo FLT1 levels (CSF and plasma) associate with biomarkers of AD neuropathology or differ between diagnostic staging in an aged cohort enriched for early disease, and (2) whether FLT1 expression interacts with amyloid on downstream outcomes, such as phosphorylated tau levels and cognitive performance. Additionally, we sought to replicate FLT1 interactions in the brain. The results showed that higher levels of FLT1 in CSF and post-mortem brain tissue related to increased tau, particularly among amyloid positive individuals. These analyses help clarify the potential utility of FLT1 as a biomarker among individuals with evidence of brain amyloidosis.

abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features and outcomes of elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from a real word research. The clinical data of 223 consecutive elderly patients (aged ≥ 60 years) who were newly diagnosed with AML at our medical center between July 2017 and June 2022, including their clinical characteristics, genetic mutations, and survival outcomes, were retrospectively analyzed. Among the 223 patients (median age 67 years), 180 (80.7%) were diagnosed with de novo AML. Genetic mutations were identified in 138 of 149 patients tested (92.6%). The most commonly mutated genes included TET2, DNMT3A, NPM1, FLT3-ITD, ASXL1, IDH2, RUNX1, TP53, and CEBPA. Among these genes, TET2, DNMT3A, FLT3-ITD, and TP53 were associated with a poor outcome. Multivariate Cox's regression analysis revealed that age over 70 years, platelet count less than 100 × 109/L, albumin level less than 35 g/L, presence of infection or bleeding at diagnosis, untreated or best supportive care (BSC) treatment status, and adverse or intermediate ELN 2022 risk classification were independent prognostic factors for overall survival in elderly AML patients. Patients who received at least one induction cycle had longer overall survival times (20 months vs. 6.6 months, P < 0.001) than those who received best supportive care. Patients with ≥ 6 cycles of chemotherapy had longer overall survival times (89.2% vs. 78.5%, P = 0.007) than those with ≤ 5 cycles of therapy. The results of this study indicated that elderly AML patients had multiple genetic abnormalities and poor outcomes. Regular effective treatment can improve patient outcomes and survival. In addition to genetic abnormalities, several other clinical features can influence survival in elderly AML patients.

abstract: SMARCA2 is an attractive synthetic lethal target in human cancers with mutated, inactivated SMARCA4. We report herein the discovery of highly potent and selective SMARCA2 PROTAC degraders, as exemplified by SMD-3236, which was designed using a new, high-affinity SMARCA ligand and a potent VHL-1 ligand. SMD-3236 achieves DC50 < 1 nM and Dmax > 95% against SMARCA2 and >2000-fold degradation selectivity over SMARCA4. SMD-3236 potently inhibits cell growth in a panel of SMARCA4-deficient cell lines and displays minimal activity in SMARCA4 wild-type cell lines. SMD-3236 induces profound and persistent SMARCA2 depletion in tumor tissues for 1 week with a single administration, while sparing SMARCA4 protein. SMD-3236 effectively inhibits tumor growth with weekly administration in the H838 SMARCA4-deficient human cancer xenograft model at well-tolerated dose schedules. SMD-3236 represents a promising SMARCA2 degrader for extensive evaluation as a new therapy for the treatment of SMARCA4-deficient human cancers.

abstract: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is etiologically complex, with well-documented genetic and nongenetic origins. In this Review, we speculate that the development of IPF requires two hits: the first establishes a vulnerable bronchoalveolar epithelium, and the second triggers mechanisms that reprogram distal epithelia to initiate and perpetuate a profibrotic phenotype. While vulnerability of the bronchoalveolar epithelia is most often driven by common or rare genetic variants, subsequent injury of the bronchoalveolar epithelia results in persistent changes in cell biology that disrupt tissue homeostasis and activate fibroblasts. The dynamic biology of IPF can best be contextualized etiologically and temporally, including stages of vulnerability, early disease, and persistent and progressive lung fibrosis. These dimensions of IPF highlight critical mechanisms that adversely disrupt epithelial function, activate fibroblasts, and lead to lung remodeling. Together with better recognition of early disease, this conceptual approach should lead to the development of novel therapeutics directed at the etiologic and temporal drivers of lung fibrosis that will ultimately transform the care of patients with IPF from palliative to curative.

abstract: To investigate the relationship between the Chinese Visceral Adiposity Index (CVAI) and the risk of developing Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). Using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), we included 3,295 men aged 45 years and older. Multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline models were employed to analyze the association between CVAI and the risk of BPH. During the 4-year follow-up period, 267 cases of BPH were identified. CVAI was positively associated with the risk of developing BPH (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.07-1.42), with a significant dose-response relationship (P < 0.001). Stratified analysis showed that the effect of CVAI on BPH risk was consistent across various subgroups. There is a positive correlation between CVAI and the risk of developing BPH. Managing visceral fat content and maintaining a healthy fat distribution pattern may help reduce the risk of BPH.

abstract: Next Generation Sequencing-based subtyping and interim- and end of treatment positron emission tomography (i/eot-PET) monitoring have high potential for upfront and on-treatment risk assessment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients. We performed Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) and LymphGen genetic subtyping for the HOVON84 (n = 208, EudraCT-2006-005174-42) and PETAL (n = 204, EudraCT-2006-001641-33) trials retrospectively combined with DFCI genetic data (n = 304). For all R-CHOP treated patients (n = 592), C5/MCD- and C2/A53-subtypes show significantly worse outcome independent of the international prognostic index. For all subtypes, adverse prognostic value of i/eot-PET-positive status is confirmed. Consistent with frequent primary refractory disease, only 67% C2 patients become eot-PET-negative versus 81-88% for other subtypes. Indicative of high relapse rates, outcome of C5 i/eot-PET-negative patients remains significantly worse in HOVON-84, which trend validates in the PETAL and SAKK38-07 trials (NCT00544219). These results show the added value of integrated genetic subtyping and PET monitoring for prognostic stratification and subtype-specific trial design.

abstract: Participation in leisure and social activities (LSA) is associated with better health outcomes and lower mortality1-3. Previous observational studies demonstrated a relationship between engagement in LSA and both mental and physical health4,5. Although several studies6 examined the association between LSA and health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, their possible causal relationship has not been studied. In this study, we investigated the causal relationship between LSA and various health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, using data from genome-wide association study summary statistics (sample size = 63,926-1,557,411) and a Mendelian randomization approach. Genetically predicted LSA were associated with a reduced risk of several health outcomes, including coronary artery disease and coronary atherosclerosis. Mediation analysis indicated that these effects were partly mediated by modifiable risk factors, such as body mass index, smoking and lipid levels. These findings highlight the importance of LSA in disease prevention and health promotion.

abstract: Ocular surface chemical injuries often result in permanent visual impairment and necessitate complex, long-term treatments. Immediate and extensive irrigation serves as the first-line intervention, followed by various therapeutic protocols applied throughout different stages of the condition. To optimize outcomes, conventional regimens increasingly incorporate biological agents and surgical techniques. In recent years, nanotechnology has made significant strides, revolutionizing the management of ocular surface chemical injuries by enabling sustained drug release, enhancing treatment efficacy, and minimizing side effects. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the etiology, epidemiology, classification, and conventional therapies for ocular chemical burns, with a special focus on nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems in managing ocular surface chemical injuries. Twelve categories of nanocarrier platforms are examined, including liposomes, nanoemulsions, nanomicelles, nanowafers, nanostructured lipid carriers, nanoparticles, hydrogels, dendrimers, nanocomplexes, nanofibers, nanozymes, and nanocomposite materials, highlighting their advantages in targeted delivery, biocompatibility, and improved healing efficacy. Additionally, current challenges and limitations in the field are discussed and the future potential of nanotechnology in treating ocular diseases is explored. This review presents the most extensive examination of this topic to date, aiming to link recent advancements with broader therapeutic strategies.

abstract: Mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (MTCH2) is a regulator of apoptosis, mitochondrial dynamics, and metabolism. Loss of MTCH2 results in mitochondrial fragmentation, an increase in whole-body energy utilization, and protection against diet-induced obesity. In this study, we used temporal metabolomics on HeLa cells to show that MTCH2 deletion results in a high ATP demand, an oxidized cellular environment, and elevated utilization of lipids, amino acids, and carbohydrates, accompanied by a decrease in several metabolites. Lipidomics analysis revealed a strategic adaptive reduction in membrane lipids and an increase in storage lipids in MTCH2 knockout cells. Importantly, MTCH2 knockout cells showed an increase in mitochondrial oxidative function, which may explain the higher energy demand. Interestingly, this imbalance in energy metabolism and reductive potential triggered by MTCH2-deletion prevents NIH3T3L1 preadipocytes from differentiating into mature adipocytes, an energy consuming reductive biosynthetic process. In summary, the loss of MTCH2 leads to increased mitochondrial oxidative activity and energy demand, creating a catabolic and oxidative environment that fails to fuel the anabolic processes required for lipid accumulation and adipocyte differentiation.

abstract: Lysosomal pH dysregulation is a critical element of the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). To study the role of lysosomes in pathophysiology, probes to analyze lysosomal size, positioning, and pH are indispensable tools. Here, we developed and characterized a ratiometric genetically encoded lysosomal pH probe, RpH-ILV, targeted to a subpopulation of lysosomal intraluminal vesicles. This subpopulation behaves similarly to the general population of LAMP1-positive vesicles in terms of pH response to pharmacological stresses. In addition, RpH-ILV, which is trafficked to the lysosome via a different cytosolic motif than our previous ratiometric sensor, RpH-LAMP1, is well tolerated by the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, exhibits minimal plasma membrane fluorescence, and reveals sensitivity to the lysosomal damaging agent LLOMe, adding a valuable tool to our repertoire of lysosomal pH sensors.

abstract: The role of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (iRAS) in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression remains unclear. In this study, we generated mice with renal tubule-specific deletion of angiotensinogen (Agt; RT-Agt-/-) in both Akita and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mouse model of diabetes. Both Akita RT-Agt-/- and STZ-RT-Agt-/- mice exhibited significant attenuation of glomerular hyperfiltration, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, glomerulomegaly and tubular injury. Urinary Agt, Angiotensin II (Ang II) and oxidative stress were decreased in Akita RT-Agt-/- mice cf. Akita mice. Moreover, thickened glomerular basement membranes, podocyte foot process effacement and podocyte loss were ameliorated in Akita RT-Agt-/- mice cf. Akita mice. Mechanistically, intra-vital microscopy revealed that attenuation of glomerular hyperfiltration in Akita RT-Agt-/- mice was mediated via efferent arteriole (EA) vasodilation and afferent arteriole (AA) vasoconstriction. The AA vasoconstriction was regulated, at least partially, through tubulo-glomerular feedback by down-regulation of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) expression in renal proximal tubules. The renal protective effect of iRAS inactivation in Akita RT-Agt-/- mice was more evident than in Akita mice treated with RAS blockers. In vitro, Ang II stimulated, losartan and apocynin inhibited SGLT2 expression in immortalized human renal proximal tubular cells. These findings suggest targeting the iRAS may constitute effective treatment for DKD.

abstract: The apelin receptor (APJR) emerges as a promising drug target for cardiovascular health and muscle regeneration. While prior research unveiled the structural versatility of APJR in coupling to Gi proteins as a monomer or dimer, the dynamic regulation within the APJR dimer during activation remains poorly understood. In this study, we present the structures of the APJR dimer and monomer complexed with its endogenous ligand apelin-13. In the dimeric structure, apelin-13 binds exclusively to one protomer that is coupled with Gi proteins, revealing a distinct ligand-binding behavior within APJR homodimers. Furthermore, binding of an antagonistic antibody induces a more compact dimerization by engaging both protomers. Notably, structural analyses of the APJR dimer complexed with an agonistic antibody, with or without Gi proteins, suggest that G protein coupling may promote the dissociation of the APJR dimer during activation. These findings underscore the intricate interplay between ligands, dimerization, and G protein coupling in regulating APJR signaling pathways.

abstract: Dissecting the genetic mechanisms underlying urinary metabolite concentrations can provide molecular insights into kidney function and open possibilities for causal assessment of urinary metabolites with risk factors and disease outcomes. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics provides a high-throughput means for urinary metabolite profiling, as widely applied for blood biomarker studies. Here we report a genome-wide association study meta-analysed for 3 European cohorts comprising 8,011 individuals, covering both people with type 1 diabetes and general population settings. We identify 54 associations (p < 9.3 × 10-10) for 19 of 54 studied metabolite concentrations. Out of these, 33 were not reported previously for relevant urinary or blood metabolite traits. Subsequent two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis suggests that estimated glomerular filtration rate causally affects 13 urinary metabolite concentrations whereas urinary ethanolamine, an initial precursor for phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, was associated with higher eGFR lending support for a potential protective role. Our study provides a catalogue of genetic associations for 53 metabolites, enabling further investigation on how urinary metabolites are linked to human health.

abstract: Hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channels are members of the cyclic nucleotide-binding family and are crucial for regulating cellular automaticity in many excitable cells. HCN channel activation contributes to pain perception, and propofol, a widely used anesthetic, acts as an analgesic by inhibiting the voltage-dependent activity of HCN channels. However, the molecular determinants of propofol action on HCN channels remain unknown. Here, we use a propofol-analog photoaffinity labeling reagent to identify propofol binding sites in the human HCN1 isoform. Mass spectrometry analyses combined with molecular dynamics simulations show that a binding pocket is formed by extracellularly facing residues in the S3 and S4 transmembrane segments in the resting voltage-sensor conformation. Mutations of residues within the putative binding pocket mitigate or eliminate voltage-dependent modulation of HCN1 currents by propofol. Together, these findings reveal a conformation-specific propofol binding site that underlies voltage-dependent inhibition of HCN currents and provides a framework for identifying highly specific modulators of HCN channel gating.

abstract: Organ transplantation is the last-resort option to treat organ failure. However, less than 10% of patients benefit from this only option due to lack of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched donor organs and 25%-80% of donated organs could not find MHC-matched recipients. T cell allorecognition is the principal mechanism for allogeneic graft rejection. We herein present a "donor MHC-specific thymus vaccination" (DMTV) strategy to induce T cell tolerance to both autologous and allogeneic donor MHC. Allogeneic MHC molecules were expressed in the recipient thymus through adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery, which led to stable expression of allogeneic MHC together with the autologous MHC in the engineered thymus. During local T cell education, those T cells recognizing either autologous MHC or allogeneic MHC were equally depleted. We constructed C57BL/6-MHC and BALB/c-MHC dual immunocompatible mice via thymus vaccination of C57BL/6-MHC into the BALB/c thymus and observed long-term graft tolerance after transplantation of C57BL/6 skin and C57BL/6 mouse embryonic stem cells into the vaccinated BALB/c mice. We also validated our DMTV strategy in a bone marrow, liver, thymus (BLT)-humanized mouse model for immunocompatible allotransplantation of human embryonic stem cells. Our study suggests that the DMTV strategy is a potent avenue to introduce a donor compatible immune system in recipients, which overcomes the clinical dilemma of the extreme shortage of MHC-matched donor organs for treating patients with end-stage organ failure.

abstract: During recent decades, changes in lifestyle have led to widespread nutritional obesity and its related complications. Remodelling adipose tissue as a therapeutic goal for obesity and its complications has attracted much attention and continues to be actively explored. The endothelium lines all blood vessels and is close to all cells, including adipocytes. The endothelium has been suggested to act as a paracrine organ. We explore the role of endothelial insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), as a paracrine modulator of white adipose phenotype. We show that a reduction in endothelial IGF-1R expression in the presence of high-fat feeding in male mice leads to depot-specific beneficial white adipose tissue remodelling, increases whole-body energy expenditure and enhances insulin sensitivity via a non-cell-autonomous paracrine mechanism. We demonstrate that increased endothelial malonate may be contributory and that malonate prodrugs have potentially therapeutically relevant properties in the treatment of obesity-related metabolic disease.

abstract: Tumorigenesis involves a multifaceted and heterogeneous interplay characterized by perturbations in individual immune surveillance. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, as orchestrators of adaptive immune responses, constitute the principal component of tumor immunity. Over the past decade, the functions of tumor-specific T cells have been extensively elucidated, whereas current understanding and research regarding intratumoral B cells remain inadequate and underexplored. The delineation of B cell subsets is contingent upon distinct surface proteins and the specific transcription factors that define these subsets have yet to be fully described. Consequently, there is a pressing need for extensive and comprehensive exploration into tumor-infiltrating B cells and their cancer biology. Notably, B cells and other cellular entities assemble within the tumor milieu to establish tertiary lymphoid structures that facilitate localized immune activation and furnish novel insights for tumor research. It is of great significance to develop therapeutic strategies based on B cells, antibodies, and tertiary lymphoid structures. In this review, we address the role of B cells and tertiary lymphoid structures in tumor microenvironment, with the highlight on their spatiotemporal effect, prognostic value and therapeutic applications in tumor immunity.

abstract: Ferroptosis plays a role in tumorigenesis by affecting lipid peroxidation and metabolic pathways; however, its prognostic or therapeutic relevance in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) remains poorly understood. In this study, we developed a prognostic ferroptosis-related gene (FRG)-based risk model using cohorts of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), proposing plausible therapeutics. Differentially expressed FRGs between tumors from TCGA-PAAD and normal pancreatic tissues from Genotype-Tissue Expression were analyzed to construct a prognostic risk model using univariate and multivariate Cox regression and LASSO analyses. A model incorporating AURKA, CAV1, and PML gene expression effectively distinguished survival differences between high- and low-risk groups among TCGA-PAAD patients, with validation in two ICGC cohorts. The high-risk group was enriched in gene sets involving mTOR, MAPK, and E2F signaling. The immune and stromal cells infiltration score did not differ between the groups. Analysis of PRISM datasets using our risk model to classify pancreatic cell lines suggested the dasatinib's efficacy in the high-risk group, which was experimentally confirmed in four cell lines with a high- or low-risk signature. In conclusion, this study proposed a robust FRG-based prognostic model that may help stratify PAAD patients with poor prognoses and select potential therapeutic avenues.

abstract: Aging is a major risk factor for poor outcomes following respiratory infections. In animal models, the most severe outcomes of respiratory infections in older hosts have been associated with an increased burden of senescent cells that accumulate over time with age and create a hyperinflammatory response. Although studies using coronavirus animal models have demonstrated that removal of senescent cells with senolytics, a class of drugs that selectively kills senescent cells, resulted in reduced lung damage and increased survival, little is known about the role that senescent cells play in the outcome of influenza A viral (IAV) infections in aged mice. Here, we tested if the aged mice survival or weight loss IAV infections could be improved using three different senolytic regimens. We found that neither dasatinib plus quercetin, fisetin, nor ABT-263 improved outcomes. Furthermore, both dasatanib plus quercetin and fisetin treatments further suppressed immune infiltration than aging alone. Additionally, our data show that the short-term senolytic agents do not reduce senescent markers in our aged mouse model. These findings suggest that acute senolytic treatments do not universally reverse aging related immune phenotype against all respiratory viral infections.

abstract: Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease that is endemic worldwide and is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia accompanied by multiple severe complications, including cardiovascular disease, kidney dysfunction, neuropathy, and retinopathy. The pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and its complications is multifactorial, involving various molecular and cellular pathways. In recent years, research has indicated that mechanisms of cell death play a significant role in the advancement of diabetes and its complications. PANoptosis is a complex phenomenon caused by three cell death pathways: programmed apoptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis. The contribution of PANoptosis to diabetes and its complications remains incompletely understood. Non-coding RNA, an important molecule in gene expression regulation, has shown significant regulatory functions in a variety of diseases. This paper reviews the underlying mechanisms of diverse types of non-coding RNAs (including lncRNA, miRNA and circRNA) in regulating PANoptosis and their specific contributions in diabetes, aiming to explore how non-coding RNAs influence PANoptosis and their effects in diabetes.

authors: Borén J, Packard CJ, Binder CJ.

publication_date: 2025 Jan 2.
abstract: Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is the main structural protein of LDLs, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and lipoprotein(a), and is crucial for their formation, metabolism and atherogenic properties. In this Review, we present insights into the role of apoB-containing lipoproteins in atherogenesis, with an emphasis on the mechanisms leading to plaque initiation and growth. LDL, the most abundant cholesterol-rich lipoprotein in plasma, is causally linked to atherosclerosis. LDL enters the artery wall by transcytosis and, in vulnerable regions, is retained in the subendothelial space by binding to proteoglycans via specific sites on apoB. A maladaptive response ensues. This response involves modification of LDL particles, which promotes LDL retention and the release of bioactive lipid products that trigger inflammatory responses in vascular cells, as well as adaptive immune responses. Resident and recruited macrophages take up modified LDL, leading to foam cell formation and ultimately cell death due to inadequate cellular lipid handling. Accumulation of dead cells and cholesterol crystallization are hallmarks of the necrotic core of atherosclerotic plaques. Other apoB-containing lipoproteins, although less abundant, have substantially greater atherogenicity per particle than LDL. These lipoproteins probably contribute to atherogenesis in a similar way to LDL but might also induce additional pathogenic mechanisms. Several targets for intervention to reduce the rate of atherosclerotic lesion initiation and progression have now been identified, including lowering plasma lipoprotein levels and modulating the maladaptive responses in the artery wall.

publication_date: 2025 Jan 2.
abstract: Macrophages make up a substantial portion of the stromal compartment of the heart in health and disease. In the past decade, the origins of these cardiac macrophages have been established as two broad populations derived from either embryonic or definitive haematopoiesis and that can be distinguished by the expression of CC-motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2). These cardiac macrophage populations are transcriptionally distinct and have differing cell surface markers and divergent roles in cardiac homeostasis and disease. Embryonic-derived CCR2- macrophages are a tissue-resident population that participates in tissue development, repair and maintenance, whereas CCR2+ macrophages are derived from definitive haematopoiesis and contribute to inflammation and tissue damage. Studies from the past 5 years have leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing technologies to expand our understanding of cardiac macrophage diversity, particularly of the monocyte-derived macrophage populations that reside in the injured and diseased heart. Emerging technologies in spatial transcriptomics have enabled the identification of distinct disease-associated cellular neighbourhoods consisting of macrophages, other immune cells and fibroblasts, highlighting the involvement of macrophages in cell-cell communication. Together, these discoveries lend new insights into the role of specific macrophage populations in the pathogenesis of cardiac disease, which can pave the way for the identification of new therapeutic targets and the development of diagnostic tools. In this Review, we discuss the developmental origin of cardiac macrophages and describe newly identified cell states and associated cellular neighbourhoods in the steady state and injury settings. We also discuss various contributions and effector functions of cardiac macrophages in homeostasis and disease.

abstract: The conserved influenza hemagglutinin stem, which is a target of cross-neutralizing antibodies, is now used in vaccine strategies focused on protecting against influenza pandemics. Antibody responses to group 1 stem have been extensively characterized, but little is known about group 2. Here, we characterized the stem-specific repertoire of individuals vaccinated with one of three group 2 influenza subtypes (H3, H7, or H10). Epitope mapping revealed two epitope supersites on the group 2 stem. Antibodies targeting the central epitope were broadly cross-reactive, whereas antibodies targeting the lower epitope had narrower breadth but higher potency against H3 subtypes. The ratio of B cells targeting each of the supersites varied with the vaccine subtype, leading to differences in the cross-reactivity of the B cell response. Our findings suggest that vaccine strategies targeting both group 2 stem epitopes would be complementary, eliciting broader and more potent protection against both seasonal and pandemic influenza strains.

abstract: Decorin (DCN) is a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family within the extracellular matrix, playing a role in the growth and development of hair follicle (HF). Exosomes serve as significant mediators of intercellular communication and are involved in the cyclic regeneration of HF. Exosomes derived from dermal papilla cells (DPC-Exos) are essential for the cycling and regrowth of HF. The present study demonstrated that DCN treatment significantly enhances the proliferation of DPCs, thereby promoting hair follicle growth. miRNA sequencing revealed 442 differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs. The regulatory mechanism of exosomal miR-129-2-3p, an up-regulated differential miRNA, was further investigated. The study identified its role in transporting DPCs to HFSCs through DPC-Exos. miR-129-2-3p has been shown to suppress the expression of genes associated with HF growth and development, lower the expression of genes and proteins downstream of the TGF-β signaling pathway, promote HFSC proliferation, and decrease HFSC apoptosis. Furthermore, miR-129-2-3p displayed an antagonistic effect on activating the TGF-β/SMAD3 signaling pathway induced by SRI-011381. The findings indicate that DCN-mediated DPC-Exos influence HF growth and development through the miR-129-2-3p/SMAD3/TGF-β regulatory axis. These results may facilitate novel strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of human hair disorders, in addition to enhancing industrial wool production.

abstract: Sex differences in the outcomes of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and the profiles of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) remain unclear. We retrospectively evaluated data from 563 patients with RCC receiving systemic therapy, including first-line dual ICI combinations (i.e., immunotherapy [IO]-IO), combinations of ICIs with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (i.e., IO-TKI), TKI monotherapy, and subsequent nivolumab monotherapy. Survival and tumor response were compared between the sexes in each treatment group, and TIIC profiles were compared using 116 RCC tumor samples analyzed by flow cytometry. Progression-free survival (PFS) was shorter in female than in male patients in the IO-IO (p = 0.0227) and nivolumab monotherapy (p = 0.0478) groups. Furthermore, sex remained an independent factor for shorter PFS after adjusting for covariates in the IO-IO (p = 0.0340) and nivolumab monotherapy (p = 0.0322) groups. In contrast, PFS was not significantly different between sexes in the IO-TKI or TKI monotherapy groups (p > 0.05). Overall survival and objective response rates were not significantly different between the sexes in any of the treatment groups (p > 0.05). Some TIIC populations, including that of CD8 + T cells (p = 0.0096), decreased to a greater extent in female than in male patients in the advanced-stage population. In conclusion, the effectiveness of ICIs on PFS was lower in female patients than in male patients, potentially because of the different profiles of the immune microenvironment, particularly the decreased number of CD8 + T cells in females.

abstract: Dystrophy-associated fer-1-like protein (dysferlin) conducts plasma membrane repair. Mutations in the DYSF gene cause a panoply of genetic muscular dystrophies. We targeted a frequent loss-of-function, DYSF exon 44, founder frameshift mutation with mRNA-mediated delivery of SpCas9 in combination with a mutation-specific sgRNA to primary muscle stem cells from two homozygous patients. We observed a consistent >60% exon 44 re-framing, rescuing a full-length and functional dysferlin protein. A new mouse model harboring a humanized Dysf exon 44 with the founder mutation, hEx44mut, recapitulates the patients' phenotype and an identical re-framing outcome in primary muscle stem cells. Finally, gene-edited murine primary muscle stem-cells are able to regenerate muscle and rescue dysferlin when transplanted back into hEx44mut hosts. These findings are the first to show that a CRISPR-mediated therapy can ameliorate dysferlin deficiency. We suggest that gene-edited primary muscle stem cells could exhibit utility, not only in treating dysferlin deficiency syndromes, but also perhaps other forms of muscular dystrophy.

abstract: Chromosomal instability (CIN) is common in solid tumours and fuels evolutionary adaptation and poor prognosis by increasing intratumour heterogeneity. Systematic characterization of driver events in the TRACERx non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort identified that genetic alterations in six genes, including FAT1, result in homologous recombination (HR) repair deficiencies and CIN. Using orthogonal genetic and experimental approaches, we demonstrate that FAT1 alterations are positively selected before genome doubling and associated with HR deficiency. FAT1 ablation causes persistent replication stress, an elevated mitotic failure rate, nuclear deformation and elevated structural CIN, including chromosome translocations and radial chromosomes. FAT1 loss contributes to whole-genome doubling (a form of numerical CIN) through the dysregulation of YAP1. Co-depletion of YAP1 partially rescues numerical CIN caused by FAT1 loss but does not relieve HR deficiencies, nor structural CIN. Importantly, overexpression of constitutively active YAP15SA is sufficient to induce numerical CIN. Taken together, we show that FAT1 loss in NSCLC attenuates HR and exacerbates CIN through two distinct downstream mechanisms, leading to increased tumour heterogeneity.

abstract: The INO80 chromatin remodeling complex plays a critical role in shaping the dynamic chromatin environment. The diverse functions of the evolutionarily conserved INO80 complex have been widely reported. However, the role of INO80 in modulating the histone variant H2A.Z is controversial. Moreover, whether INO80 helps regulate heterochromatin remains unknown. Here, we characterize the regulatory effects of OsINO80 on protein-coding genes and transposable elements (TEs) in rice. Upon OsINO80 overexpression in rice, we found three types of OsINO80-occupied regions with different chromatin signatures: type I (enriched with H2A.Z), type II (enriched with H3K9me2), and type III (deficient in H2A.Z/H3K9me2). Loss of OsINO80 results in a decrease in H3K27me3, but not H2A.Z, at type I regions as well as a decrease in H3K9me2 at type II regions, which correlates with TE activation and transposition. Our findings reveal that OsINO80 facilitates H3K27me3 establishment, promotes H3K9me2 deposition, and maintains TE silencing.

abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for solid tumors faces significant challenges, including inadequate infiltration, limited proliferation, diminished effector function of CAR T cells, and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, we utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas database to identify key chemokines (CCL4, CCL5, and CCR5) associated with T cell infiltration across various solid tumor types. The CCL4/CCL5-CCR5 axis emerged as significantly correlated with the presence of T cells within tumors, and enhancing the expression of CCR5 in CAR T cells bolstered their migratory capacity. Furthermore, single-cell immunoprofiling of tumor tissues revealed that macrophages within the TME primarily interact with CD8+ T cells, impeding their tumor response. However, CAR T cells engineered to secrete Interleukin (IL)-12 can counteract macrophage-mediated immunosuppression and augment T cell functionality. To address these obstacles, we employed esophageal carcinoma as a model to develop mesothelin-targeted CAR T cells co-expressing CCR5 and IL-12 (CARTmeso-5-12), subsequently assessing their antitumor capabilities in vitro and in vivo. The CARTmeso-5-12 cells demonstrated enhanced tumor infiltration due to overexpression of CCR5, and IL-12 secretion further amplified CAR T cell efficacy by attenuating the suppressive influence of tumor-infiltrating macrophages, thus improving tumor eradication.

abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is stratified into four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS1-4). CMS3 represents the metabolic subtype, but its wiring remains largely undefined. To identify the underlying tumorigenesis of CMS3, organoids derived from 16 genetically engineered mouse models are analyzed. Upon in vitro Cre-recombinase activation, transformation is established and transcriptional profiling reveals that distinct CMSs (CMS2-4) are modeled with different organoids. CMS3-like, metabolic signature-positive, organoids are induced by KRAS mutations. Interestingly, metabolic signatures are subsequently shown to result from enterocyte-like differentiation both in organoids and human cancers. Further analysis reveals carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1 (CPS1) and sucrase-isomaltase (SI) as signature proteins. More importantly, CPS1 is crucial for de novo pyrimidine synthesis in CMS3 and its inhibition targets proliferation and stemness, facilitating enterocyte-like differentiation, while CMS2 and CMS4 models are not affected. Our data point to an enterocyte-like differentiation of CMS3 CRCs and reveal a selective vulnerability of this subtype through CPS1 inhibition.

abstract: Cinnamon, renowned for its aromatic flavor, represents one of the most widely used spices worldwide. Cinnamon is also considered beneficial to human health with therapeutic potential for treating various diseases, ranging from diabetes and cancer to neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying cinnamon's health benefits remain elusive. It is also unclear whether cinnamon has any role in aging. Using C. elegans as a model, here we show that feeding worms cinnamaldehyde (CA), the active ingredient in cinnamon oil, prolongs longevity. CA also promotes stress resistance and reduces β-Amyloid toxicity in a C. elegans model of Alzheimer's disease. Mechanistically, CA exerts its beneficial effects through mTORC1 and autophagy signaling. Interestingly, CA promotes longevity by inducing a dietary restriction-like state without affecting food intake, suggesting CA as a dietary restriction mimetic. In human cells, CA exerts a similar effect on mTORC1 and autophagy signaling, suggesting a conserved mechanism. Our results demonstrate that dietary cinnamon promotes both lifespan and healthspan and does so by regulating mTORC1 and autophagy signaling.

abstract: Although the antiallergic properties of compounds such as CAPE, Melatonin, Curcumin, and Vitamin C have been poorly discussed by experimental studies, the antiallergic properties of these famous molecules have never been discussed with calculations. The histamine-1 receptor (H1R) belongs to the family of rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors expressed in cells that mediate allergies and other pathophysiological diseases. In this study, pharmacological activities of FDA-approved second generation H1 antihistamines (Levocetirizine, desloratadine and fexofenadine) and molecules such as CAPE, Melatonin, Curcumin, Vitamin C, ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) profiles, density functional theory (DFT), molecular docking, biological targets and activities were compared by calculating. Since drug development is an extremely risky, costly and time-consuming process, the data obtained in this study will facilitate and guide future studies. It will also enable researchers to focus on the most promising compounds, providing an effective design strategy. Their pharmacological activity was carried out using computer-based computational techniques including DFT, molecular docking, ADMET analysis, biological targeting, and activity methods. The best binding sites of Desloratadine, Levocetirizine, Fexofenadine, CAPE, Quercetin, Melatonin, curcumin, Vitamin C ligands to Desmoglein 1, Human Histamine H1 receptor, IgE and IL13 protons were determined by molecular docking method and binding energy and interaction states were analyzed. Fexofenadine and Quercetin ligand showed the most effective binding affinity. Melatonin had the best Caco-2 permeability PPB values of Quercetin, CAPE and Curcumin were at optimal levels. On the OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 of curcumin and CAPE, Quercetin was found to have strong inhibition effects on BCRP. Melatonin and CAPE were found to have the highest inhibition values on CYP1A2, while CAPE had the highest inhibition values on CYP2C19 and CYP2C9. Vitamin C and Quercetin were found to be safer in terms of cardiac toxicity and mutagenic risks, while Desloratadine and Levocetirizine carried high risks of neurotoxicity and hematotoxicity, while CAPE was noted for its high enzyme inhibitory activities and low toxicity profiles, while the hERG blockade, DILI, and cytotoxicity values of other compounds pointed to various safety concerns. This study demonstrated the potential of machine learning methods in understanding and discovering H1 receptor blockers. The results obtained provide important clues in the development of important strategies in the clinical use of H1 receptor blockers. In the light of these data, CAPE and Quercetin are remarkable molecules.

abstract: Cinnamon, renowned for its aromatic flavor, represents one of the most widely used spices worldwide. Cinnamon is also considered beneficial to human health with therapeutic potential for treating various diseases, ranging from diabetes and cancer to neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying cinnamon's health benefits remain elusive. It is also unclear whether cinnamon has any role in aging. Using C. elegans as a model, here we show that feeding worms cinnamaldehyde (CA), the active ingredient in cinnamon oil, prolongs longevity. CA also promotes stress resistance and reduces β-Amyloid toxicity in a C. elegans model of Alzheimer's disease. Mechanistically, CA exerts its beneficial effects through mTORC1 and autophagy signaling. Interestingly, CA promotes longevity by inducing a dietary restriction-like state without affecting food intake, suggesting CA as a dietary restriction mimetic. In human cells, CA exerts a similar effect on mTORC1 and autophagy signaling, suggesting a conserved mechanism. Our results demonstrate that dietary cinnamon promotes both lifespan and healthspan and does so by regulating mTORC1 and autophagy signaling.

abstract: Although the antiallergic properties of compounds such as CAPE, Melatonin, Curcumin, and Vitamin C have been poorly discussed by experimental studies, the antiallergic properties of these famous molecules have never been discussed with calculations. The histamine-1 receptor (H1R) belongs to the family of rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors expressed in cells that mediate allergies and other pathophysiological diseases. In this study, pharmacological activities of FDA-approved second generation H1 antihistamines (Levocetirizine, desloratadine and fexofenadine) and molecules such as CAPE, Melatonin, Curcumin, Vitamin C, ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) profiles, density functional theory (DFT), molecular docking, biological targets and activities were compared by calculating. Since drug development is an extremely risky, costly and time-consuming process, the data obtained in this study will facilitate and guide future studies. It will also enable researchers to focus on the most promising compounds, providing an effective design strategy. Their pharmacological activity was carried out using computer-based computational techniques including DFT, molecular docking, ADMET analysis, biological targeting, and activity methods. The best binding sites of Desloratadine, Levocetirizine, Fexofenadine, CAPE, Quercetin, Melatonin, curcumin, Vitamin C ligands to Desmoglein 1, Human Histamine H1 receptor, IgE and IL13 protons were determined by molecular docking method and binding energy and interaction states were analyzed.

abstract: Lung cancer remains the foremost cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Clinical observations reveal a notable increase in both the proportion and mortality rate among female non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients compared to males, a trend that continues to escalate. Extensive preclinical research underscores the pivotal role of estrogen in the initiation, progression, prognosis, and treatment response of NSCLC. Estrogen receptors are widely expressed in stromal and immune cells, influencing cellular activities across innate and adaptive immune systems. Immune evasion mechanisms significantly impact tumor development and outcomes, with immunotherapy offering promise in NSCLC by targeting these mechanisms. The intriguing gender disparities in immunotherapy responses prompt an exploration into the data on NSCLC occurrence, progression, and gender-specific immunotherapy. Evidence highlights estrogen's contribution to a tumor-permissive microenvironment, influencing various cells including cancer-associated fibroblasts, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, B cells, and T cells. Gender-specific variations in NSCLC occurrence, development, prognosis, and treatment efficacy likely stem from interactions between estrogen, lung cancer cells, and these estrogen-responsive cells, shaping a microenvironment conducive to tumor progression. Clarifying estrogen's role and its signaling pathways in NSCLC may unveil novel therapeutic strategies to modify the tumor microenvironment or enhance immunotherapy efficacy.

abstract: Microglia dysfunction-associated neuroinflammation is an important driver of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that demyelination promotes neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment via the lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS)-GPR34 axis in AD. Demyelination is observed at the early stage and is accompanied by an increase in LysoPS in myelin debris in a 5xFAD mouse model of AD. Reducing the content of LysoPS in myelin or inhibiting its receptor GPR34 via genetic or pharmacological approaches can reduce microglial dysfunction and neuroinflammation and improve microglial Aβ phagocytosis, subsequently resulting in less Aβ deposition and memory restoration in 5xFAD mice. Furthermore, increased LysoPS production and microglial GPR34 expression were also observed in the brains of AD patients. These results reveal the pathogenic role of demyelination-derived LysoPS in microglial dysfunction and AD pathology and suggest that blocking GPR34 as a therapeutic strategy beyond targeting Aβ.

abstract: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with adverse hospitalization. Previous studies have reported that an elevated triglyceride glucose (TyG) index is significantly associated with the development of AKI in patients with cardiovascular disease, as well as in those undergoing surgery; however, the potential of the TyG index to predict AKI following neurotrauma remains unclear. Patients diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Chinese tertiary hospitals between January 2014 and December 2023 were included in this retrospective study. The outcome was the incidence of AKI. TyG was identified as an independent risk factor for AKI using logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM). Finally, the association between TyG index and AKI was further assessed using multivariate logistic regression, restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression, and subgroup analysis. The present study enrolled 1,505 patients with TBI, of whom 66.45% were male, with an average age of 55.47 ± 17.32 years. The incidence of AKI was 9.4%. Multiple logistic regression analyses identified a relationship between the TyG levels and AKI risk. This relationship was retained after PSM. A significant positive correlation between TyG level and AKI was observed in all three models constructed using multivariate logistic regression. RCS regression analyses further indicated a linear increase in AKI risk with an increasing TyG index. In subgroup analyses, this correlation remained stable for the majority of the population but could be influenced by sex. TyG levels were positively correlated with the risk of AKI development in patients following TBI. As a predictive biomarker, the TyG index enables effective risk stratification and customization of management protocols to mitigate AKI in these patients, thus enhancing clinical outcomes.

abstract: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) plays a crucial role in DNA repair and genomic stability maintenance. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing PARP1 activity, particularly through deubiquitination, remain poorly elucidated. Using a deubiquitinase (DUB) library binding screen, we identified cylindromatosis (CYLD) as a bona fide DUB for PARP1 in breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, CYLD is recruited by PARP1 to DNA lesions upon genotoxic stress, where it cleaves K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on PARP1 at residues K748, K940, and K949, resulting in compromised PARP1 activation. In a reciprocal manner, PARP1 PARylates CYLD at sites E191, E231, E259, and E509, thereby enhancing its DUB activity. Consequently, depletion of CYLD leads to increased efficiency in base excision repair and confers breast cancer cells with resistance to alkylating agents. Conversely, overexpression of CYLD enhances sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (PARPi) even in homologous recombination-proficient breast cancer cells. These findings offer unique insights into the intricate interplay between CYLD and PARP1 in DNA repair, underscoring the pivotal role of targeting this regulatory axis for breast cancer chemotherapy.

abstract: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), osteoarthritis (OA), and osteoporosis (OP) are common musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) with similar age-related risk factors, representing the leading causes of disability. However, successful therapeutic development and translation have been hampered by the lack of clinically-relevant animal models. In this study, we investigated the potential suitability of the tree shrew, a small mammal with a close genetic relationship to primates, as a new animal model for MSDs. Age-related spontaneous IDD in parallel with a gradual disappearance of notochordal cells were commonly observed in tree shrews upon skeletal maturity with no sex differences, while age-related osteoporotic changes including bone loss in the metaphyses were primarily presented in aged females, similar to observations in humans. Moreover, in the osteochondral defect model, tree shrew cartilage exhibited behavior similar to that of humans, characterized by a more restricted self-healing capacity compared to the rapid spontaneous healing of joint surfaces observed in rats. The induced OA model in tree shrews was highly efficient and reproducible, characterized by gradual deterioration of articular cartilage, recapitulating the human OA phenotype to some degree. Surgery-induced IDD models were successfully established in tree shrews, in which the lumbar spine instability model developed slow progressive disc degeneration with more similarity to the clinical state, whereas the needle puncture model led to the rapid development of IDD with more severe symptoms. Taken together, our findings pave the way for the development of the tree shrew as a new animal model for the study of MSDs and aging.

abstract: Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), like many solid tumors, elicit ineffective immune responses. However, patients with cHL are highly responsive to PD-1 blockade, which largely depends on HRS cell-specific retention of MHC class II and implicates CD4+ T cells and additional MHC class I-independent immune effectors. Here, we utilize single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial analysis to define shared circulating and microenvironmental features of the immune response to PD-1 blockade in cHL. Compared with non-responders, responding patients have more circulating CD4+ naïve and central memory T cells and B cells, as well as more diverse CD4+ T cell and B cell receptor repertoires. Importantly, a population of circulating and tumor-infiltrating IL1β+ monocytes/macrophages is detectable in patients with cHL but not healthy donors, and a proinflammatory, tumor-promoting signature of these circulating IL1β+ monocytes is associated with resistance to PD-1 blockade in cHL. Altogether, our findings reveal extensive immune rewiring and complementary roles of CD4+ T cells, B cells and IL1β+ monocytes in the response to PD-1 blockade and suggest that these features can be captured with a peripheral blood test.

abstract: The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen leader protein (EBNALP) is essential for the immortalization of naive B lymphocytes (NBLs). However, the mechanisms remain elusive. To understand EBNALP's role in B-cell transformation, we compare NBLs infected with wild-type EBV and an EBNALP-null mutant EBV using multi-omics techniques. EBNALP inactivation alters enhancer-promoter interactions, resulting in decreased CCND2 and increased CASP1 and BCL2L11 expression. Mechanistically, EBNALP interacts with and colocalizes with the looping factor YY1. Depletion of EBNALP reduces YY1 DNA-binding and enhancer-promoter interactions, similar to effects observed with YY1 depletion. Furthermore, EBNALP colocalizes with DPF2, a protein that binds to H3K14ac and H4K16ac. CRISPR depletion of DPF2 reduces both EBNALP and YY1 DNA binding, suggesting that the DPF2/EBNALP complex may tether YY1 to DNA to increase enhancer-promoter interactions. EBNALP inactivation also increases enhancer-promoter interactions at the CASP1 and BCL2L11 loci, along with elevated DPF2 and YY1 binding and DNA accessibility. Our data suggest that EBNALP regulates YY1 to rewire the host genome, which might facilitate naive B-cell transformation.

abstract: This study aimed to assess the validity and reliability of a questionnaire on patient acceptance of orthodontic retainers. The original questionnaire was forward- and backward-translated, followed by four validity tests (content validity, face validity, construct validity, criterion validity) and two reliability tests (test-retest reliability, internal consistency). Content validity was assessed by nine orthodontists who appraised the questionnaire's representativeness, relevance, clarity, and necessity. Face validity was established through semi-structured in-depth interviews with 35 English-literate participants currently wearing orthodontic retainers. Construct validity was established through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). For criterion validity, 107 participants concurrently answered the questionnaire and the Retainer-modified Malaysian Oral Health Impact Profile questionnaire. Test-retest reliability was verified by 34 subjects who responded to the questionnaire again after a two-week interval. Six revised items passed the threshold value of 0.78 for Item-Content Validity Index and Content Validity Ratio and were revised based on findings from the face validity test. Principal Component Analysis of EFA extracted information on only one component, and all items were positively correlated with the component matrix. Spearman's rho value (rs = 0.490 and rs = 0.416) indicated a moderate correlation between the two questionnaires for criterion validity. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient ranged from 0.687 to 0.913, indicating moderate to excellent test-retest reliability. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.687 to 0.913 indicating that none of the questionnaire items showed unacceptable or poor internal consistency. The questionnaire on patient acceptance of orthodontic retainers has been validated and can be used in both clinical and research settings.

abstract: Adipocyte lipolysis controls systemic energy levels and metabolic homeostasis. Lipolysis is regulated by posttranslational modifications of key lipolytic enzymes. However, less is known about the transcriptional mechanisms that regulate lipolysis. Here, we identify interferon regulatory factor-2 binding protein 2 (IRF2BP2) as a transcriptional repressor of adipocyte lipolysis. Deletion of IRF2BP2 in human adipocytes increases lipolysis without affecting glucose uptake, whereas IRF2BP2 overexpression decreases lipolysis. RNA sequencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses show that IRF2BP2 represses lipolysis-related genes, including LIPE, which encodes hormone sensitive lipase, the rate-limiting enzyme in lipolysis. Adipocyte-selective deletion of Irf2bp2 in mice increases Lipe expression and free fatty acid levels, resulting in adipose tissue inflammation and glucose intolerance. Together, these findings demonstrate that IRF2BP2 restrains adipocyte lipolysis and opens avenues to target lipolysis for the treatment of metabolic disease.

abstract: Metastasis remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, irrespective of the primary tumour origin. However, the core gene regulatory program governing distinct stages of metastasis across cancers remains poorly understood. We investigate this through single-cell transcriptome analysis encompassing over two hundred patients with metastatic and non-metastatic tumours across six cancer types. Our analysis revealed a prognostic core gene signature that provides insights into the intricate cellular dynamics and gene regulatory networks driving metastasis progression at the pan-cancer and single-cell level. Notably, the dissection of transcription factor networks active across different stages of metastasis, combined with functional perturbation, identified SP1 and KLF5 as key regulators, acting as drivers and suppressors of metastasis, respectively, at critical steps of this transition across multiple cancer types. Through in vivo and in vitro loss of function of SP1 in cancer cells, we revealed its role in driving cancer cell survival, invasive growth, and metastatic colonisation. Furthermore, tumour cells and the microenvironment increasingly engage in communication through WNT signalling as metastasis progresses, driven by SP1. Further validating these observations, a drug repurposing analysis identified distinct FDA-approved drugs with anti-metastasis properties, including inhibitors of WNT signalling across various cancers.

abstract: Radiopharmaceuticals involve the local delivery of radionuclides to targeted lesions for the diagnosis and treatment of multiple diseases. Radiopharmaceutical therapy, which directly causes systematic and irreparable damage to targeted cells, has attracted increasing attention in the treatment of refractory diseases that are not sensitive to current therapies. As the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE, [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and their complementary diagnostic agents, namely, [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE and [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, targeted radiopharmaceutical-based theranostics (radiotheranostics) are being increasingly implemented in clinical practice in oncology, which lead to a new era of radiopharmaceuticals. The new generation of radiopharmaceuticals utilizes a targeting vector to achieve the accurate delivery of radionuclides to lesions and avoid off-target deposition, making it possible to improve the efficiency and biosafety of tumour diagnosis and therapy. Numerous studies have focused on developing novel radiopharmaceuticals targeting a broader range of disease targets, demonstrating remarkable in vivo performance. These include high tumor uptake, prolonged retention time, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties that align with clinical standards. While radiotheranostics have been widely applied in tumor diagnosis and therapy, their applications are now expanding to neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and inflammation. Furthermore, radiotheranostic-empowered precision medicine is revolutionizing the cancer treatment paradigm. Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals play a pivotal role in patient stratification and treatment planning, leading to improved therapeutic outcomes in targeted radionuclide therapy. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the evolution of radiopharmaceuticals, including both FDA-approved and clinically investigated agents, and explores the mechanisms of cell death induced by radiopharmaceuticals. It emphasizes the significance and future prospects of theranostic-based radiopharmaceuticals in advancing precision medicine.

      Hepatocyte transplantation has shown promise for genetic diseases of the hepatocytes but to date has shown limited efficacy for non-genetic forms of severe liver injury. Limited cell engraftment and poor function of donor hepatocytes in recipient livers impacts the clinical utility of hepatocyte cell therapy. The mechanisms underpinning this are poorly understood. We explored this in a liver injury model, where predictable levels of injury and hepatocyte senescence was induced in AhCreMdm2fl/fl mice through genetic excision of hepatocyte Mdm2.

abstract: With an increasing number of studies delving into the impact of dietary supplements on combat sports performance, researchers are actively seeking a more efficient dietary supplement for use in these sports. Nonetheless, controversies persist. Hence, we undertook a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis to discern the most effective dietary supplements in combat sports by synthesizing the available evidence. We conducted a comprehensive search across PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, Embase, and SPORTDiscus, covering the period from their establishment to November 2, 2023. Our aim was to identify randomized controlled trials that evaluated the benefits of various dietary supplements for elite combat sports athletes. The risk of bias in these trials was assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomized Trials. Subsequently, we employed Bayesian network meta-analysis through R software and Stata 15.0. During the analysis, we performed subgroup analysis based on the type of combat, distinguishing between striking and grappling disciplines. The analysis is based on 67 randomized controlled trials that meet all the inclusion criteria, involving 1026 elite combat sports athletes randomly assigned to 26 different dietary supplements or placebos. Results from the 50 trials included in the network meta-analysis indicate that compared to a placebo, sodium bicarbonate combined with caffeine (SMD: 2.3, 95% CrI: 1.5, 3.2), caffeine (SMD: 0.72, 95% CrI: 0.53, 0.93), beta-alanine (SMD: 0.58, 95% CrI: 0.079, 1.1), and sodium bicarbonate (SMD: 0.54, 95% CrI: 0.30, 0.81) was associated with a statistically significant increase in blood lactate concentrations. Compared to placebo, caffeine (SMD: 0.27, 95% CrI: 0.12, 0.41) was associated with a statistically significant increase in the final heart rate. Compared to placebo, creatine combined with sodium bicarbonate (SMD: 2.2, 95% CrI: 1.5, 3.1), creatine (SMD: 1.0, 95% CrI: 0.38, 1.6), and sodium bicarbonate (SMD: 0.42, 95% CrI: 0.18, 0.66) was associated with a statistically significant increase in mean power. Compared to placebo, creatine combined with sodium bicarbonate (SMD: 1.6, 95% CrI: 0.85, 2.3), creatine (SMD: 1.1, 95% CrI: 0.45, 1.7), and sodium bicarbonate (SMD: 0.35, 95% CrI: 0.11, 0.57) was associated with a statistically significant increase in peak power. Compared to placebo, caffeine (SMD: 1.4, 95% CrI: 0.19, 2.7) was associated with a statistically significant increase in the number of kicks. Compared to placebo, caffeine (SMD: 0.35, 95% CrI: 0.081, 0.61) was associated with a statistically significant increase in the number of throws. This study suggests that a range of dietary supplements, including caffeine, sodium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate combined with caffeine, creatine, creatine combined with sodium bicarbonate, and beta-alanine can improve the athletic performance of elite combat sports athletes.

Article Title: Discovery of Titin and Its Role in Heart Function and Disease.
pmid: 39745989

source: Circulation research
publication_date: 2025 Jan 3;136(1):135-157.
abstract: This review examines the giant elastic protein titin and its critical roles in heart function, both in health and disease, as discovered since its identification nearly 50 years ago. Encoded by the TTN (titin gene), titin has emerged as a major disease locus for cardiac disorders. Functionally, titin acts as a third myofilament type, connecting sarcomeric Z-disks and M-bands, and regulating myocardial passive stiffness and stretch sensing. Its I-band segment, which includes the N2B element and the PEVK (proline, glutamate, valine, and lysine-rich regions), serves as a viscoelastic spring, adjusting sarcomere length and force in response to cardiac stretch. The review details how alternative splicing of titin pre-mRNA produces different isoforms that greatly impact passive tension and cardiac function, under physiological and pathological conditions. Key posttranslational modifications, especially phosphorylation, play crucial roles in adjusting titin's stiffness, allowing for rapid adaptation to changing hemodynamic demands. Abnormal titin modifications and dysregulation of isoforms are linked to cardiac diseases such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, where increased stiffness impairs diastolic function. In addition, the review discusses the importance of the A-band region of titin in setting thick filament length and enhancing Ca²+ sensitivity, contributing to the Frank-Starling Mechanism of the heart. TTN truncating variants are frequently associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, and the review outlines potential disease mechanisms, including haploinsufficiency, sarcomere disarray, and altered thick filament regulation. Variants in TTN have also been linked to conditions such as peripartum cardiomyopathy and chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy. Therapeutic avenues are explored, including targeting splicing factors such as RBM20 (RNA binding motif protein 20) to adjust isoform ratios or using engineered heart tissues to study disease mechanisms. Advances in genetic engineering, including CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), offer promise for modifying TTN to treat titin-related cardiomyopathies. This comprehensive review highlights titin's structural, mechanical, and signaling roles in heart function and the impact of TTN mutations on cardiac diseases.

abstract: For the protozoan parasite Leishmania, completion of its life cycle requires sequential adaptation of cellular physiology and nutrient scavenging mechanisms to the different environments of a sand fly alimentary tract and the acidic mammalian host cell phagolysosome. Transmembrane transporters are the gatekeepers of intracellular environments, controlling the flux of solutes and ions across membranes. To discover which transporters are vital for survival as intracellular amastigote forms, we carried out a systematic loss-of-function screen of the L. mexicana transportome. A total of 312 protein components of small molecule carriers, ion channels and pumps were identified and targeted in a CRISPR-Cas9 gene deletion screen in the promastigote form, yielding 188 viable null mutants. Forty transporter deletions caused significant loss of fitness in macrophage and mouse infections. A striking example is the Vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase), which, unexpectedly, was dispensable for promastigote growth in vitro but essential for survival of the disease-causing amastigotes.

abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and the aggregation of tau protein, resulting in intense memory loss and dementia. Diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction (DACD) is a complication of diabetes mellitus, which is associated with decreased cognitive function and impaired memory. A growing body of literature emphasize the involvement of microglia in AD and DACD. Although AD and DACD share some common features related to symptomatology and pathophysiology, the characteristics and heterogeneity of microglia remain largely unknown in these two diseases. In this study, multiple bioinformatics analyses were performed to analyze the frequency, altered genes, cell-cell communication, and subtypes of microglia in AD and DACD mouse models based on two publicly single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) datasets. The results revealed that the frequency of microglia was increased in both AD and DACD mouse models when compared with control mice. After analyzing the differentially expressed genes of microglia from the two mouse models, only six common upregulated genes were found. The CellChat analysis revealed the complex cell-cell communication network (microglia clusters with other cell types) in 5XFAD vs. control mice and db/db vs. control mice. The microglia subtypes and their transcription factor activity profile in 5XFAD mice were different from that in db/db mice. In summary, this study provided some insights into the alterations of microglia in 5XFAD and db/db mice, which might open up potential avenues for the microglial-targeted therapy in AD and DACD.

abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI) mobilizes macrophages, the central protagonists of tissue repair in the infarcted heart. Although necessary for repair, macrophages also contribute to adverse remodeling and progression to heart failure. In this context, specific targeting of inflammatory macrophage activation may attenuate maladaptive responses and enhance cardiac repair. Allograft inflammatory factor 1 (AIF1) is a macrophage-specific protein expressed in a variety of inflammatory settings, but its function after MI is unknown. Here we identify a maladaptive role for macrophage AIF1 after MI in mice. Mechanistic studies show that AIF1 increases actin remodeling in macrophages to promote reactive oxygen species-dependent activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α. This directs a switch to glycolytic metabolism to fuel macrophage-mediated inflammation, adverse ventricular remodeling and progression to heart failure. Targeted knockdown of Aif1 using antisense oligonucleotides improved cardiac repair, supporting further exploration of macrophage AIF1 as a therapeutic target after MI.

abstract: In male animals, spermatogonia in testes differentiate into sperm, one of the most diverse cell types across species. Despite the evolutionary retention of key genes essential for spermatogenesis, the extent of their conservation remains unclear. To explore the genetic basis of spermatogenesis under strong selective pressure, we compare single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from the testes of humans, mice, and fruit flies. Our analysis identifies conserved genes involved in key molecular programs, such as post-transcriptional regulation, meiosis, and energy metabolism. We perform gene knockout experiments of 20 candidate genes, three of which, when mutated in fruit flies, result in reduced male fertility, emphasizing the conservation of sperm centriole and steroid lipid processes across mammals and Drosophila. Additionally, deep-learning analysis uncovers potential transcriptional mechanisms driving gene-expression evolution. These findings establish a core genetic foundation for spermatogenesis, offering insights into sperm-phenotype evolution and the underlying mechanisms of male infertility.

abstract: TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) has emerged as a critical player in neurodegenerative disorders, with its dysfunction implicated in a wide spectrum of diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This comprehensive review explores the multifaceted roles of TDP-43 in both physiological and pathological contexts. We delve into TDP-43's crucial functions in RNA metabolism, including splicing regulation, mRNA stability, and miRNA biogenesis. Particular emphasis is placed on recent discoveries regarding TDP-43's involvement in DNA interactions and chromatin dynamics, highlighting its broader impact on gene expression and genome stability. The review also examines the complex pathogenesis of TDP-43-related disorders, discussing the protein's propensity for aggregation, its effects on mitochondrial function, and its non-cell autonomous impacts on glial cells. We provide an in-depth analysis of TDP-43 pathology across various neurodegenerative conditions, from well-established associations in ALS and FTLD to emerging roles in diseases such as Huntington's disease and Niemann-Pick C disease. The potential of TDP-43 as a therapeutic target is explored, with a focus on recent developments in targeting cryptic exon inclusion and other TDP-43-mediated processes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on TDP-43 biology and pathology, offering insights into the protein's central role in neurodegeneration and highlighting promising avenues for future research and therapeutic interventions.

abstract: Objective: Adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are increasingly overweight or obese, in part due to intensive insulin therapy. Newer non-insulin medications targeting both hyperglycemia and weight loss are approved for people with type 2 diabetes. These drugs also reduce cardiovascular disease, the major cause of mortality in people with diabetes. We assessed the real-world use of semaglutide and tirzepatide, in adults with T1D followed in a specialty diabetes clinic. Materials and Methods: This retrospective chart review included 100 adults who were prescribed semaglutide or tirzepatide (50 each) and 50 controls frequency matched for age, sex, diabetes duration, body mass index, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and who did not receive any weight loss medications during the study period. Data were collected prior to initiation of weight loss medications (baseline) and then for up to 1 year for each patient. Results: Matching characteristics did not differ between cases and controls. There were declines in weight in both semaglutide (-19.2 ± standard error (SE) 2.9 lbs. [9.1% body weight lost]) and tirzepatide (-49.4 ± SE 3.0 lbs. [21.4% body weight lost]) groups, and HbA1c decreased in both semaglutide (-0.54 ± SE 0.14%, P = 0.0001) and tirzepatide users (-0.68 ± SE 0.16%, P < 0.0001) over 12 months. Weight and HbA1c didn't change in controls. Conclusions: We observed weight loss of 9.1% and 21.4% and improved glucose control in semaglutide and tirzepatide users, respectively, after 1 year of off-label use. As off-label use of these drugs is increasing in patients with T1D, larger, prospective safety and efficacy trials are needed.

abstract: Deep phenotyping can enhance the power of genetic analysis, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but the occurrence of missing phenotypes compromises the potential of such resources. Although many phenotypic imputation methods have been developed, the accurate imputation of millions of individuals remains challenging. In the present study, we have developed a multi-phenotype imputation method based on mixed fast random forest (PIXANT) by leveraging efficient machine learning (ML)-based algorithms. We demonstrate by extensive simulations that PIXANT is reliable, robust and highly resource-efficient. We then apply PIXANT to the UKB data of 277,301 unrelated White British citizens and 425 traits, and GWAS is subsequently performed on the imputed phenotypes, 18.4% more GWAS loci are identified than before imputation (8710 vs 7355). The increased statistical power of GWAS identified some additional candidate genes affecting heart rate, such as RNF220, SCN10A, and RGS6, suggesting that the use of imputed phenotype data from a large cohort may lead to the discovery of additional candidate genes for complex traits.

abstract: The advancements in cardiovascular imaging over the past two decades have been significant. The miniaturization of ultrasound devices has greatly contributed to their widespread adoption in operating rooms and intensive care units. The integration of AI-enabled tools has further transformed the field by simplifying echocardiographic evaluations and enhancing the reproducibility of hemodynamic measurements, even for less experienced operators. Speckle tracking echocardiography offers a direct, visual, and quantitative assessment of myocardial shortening, serving as a compelling alternative to traditional methods for evaluating right and left ventricular systolic function. In critically ill patients, sublingual microcirculation imaging has revealed a high prevalence of microvascular alterations, which are markers of disease severity. The use of handheld vital microscopes enables the quantification of several key parameters, including vessel density, perfusion, red blood cell velocity, and the perfused vascular density. Such metrics are useful for evaluating microcirculatory health. The development of automated software marks a significant advance toward real-time bedside microvascular assessment. These advancements could eventually allow shock resuscitation to be tailored based on microvascular responses. In parallel with imaging advances, cardiac output monitors have evolved significantly. Once cumbersome devices displaying basic numerical data in tabular form, they now feature sleek, touch-screen interfaces integrated with visual decision-support tools. These tools synthesize hemodynamic data into intuitive graphical formats, allowing clinicians to quickly grasp the determinants of circulatory shock. This visual clarity supports more efficient and accurate decision-making, which may ultimately lead to improved patient care and outcomes.

abstract: Early missed abortion is defined as a pregnancy of ≤ 12 weeks in which there is a cessation of life in the developing embryo or fetus, leading to its retention within the uterine cavity without being spontaneously expelled promptly. This condition is commonly observed and significantly impacts human reproductive health. This study aimed to identify key genes related to ferroptosis that could serve as novel biomarkers for early missed abortion. Findings from gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses indicate a correlation between iron- DEFRGS in key modules and the p53 signaling, mitophagy-animal, and protein digestion and absorption pathways. An analysis of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was conducted on DEFRGs, identifying five central genes (TP53, EZH2, TIMP1, SLC3A2, and GABARAPL2) using STRING and Cytohubba ROC curves. The expression of pivotal genes in both the missed-abortion and control groups was verified by RT-qPCR. CIBERSORT analysis revealed a notable increase in the infiltration levels of CD8 + T lymphocytes and M2 macrophages among individuals in the early missed abortion group. Additionally, a ceRNA network was constructed to predict interactions between mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA of the central genes. However, the interacting miRNAs predicted for SLC3A2 in the miRanda, miRDB, and TargetScan databases were limited to hsa-miR-661 and hsa-miR-4311, with no interacting lncRNAs found in the spongeScan database. This research has identified novel genes that could be targeted for the early detection and management of missed abortions.

abstract: The ESCRT machinery mediates membrane remodeling in numerous processes in cells including cell division and nuclear membrane reformation. The identification of ESCRT homologs in Asgard archaea, currently considered the closest prokaryotic relative of eukaryotes, implies a role for ESCRTs in the membrane remodeling processes that occurred during eukaryogenesis. Yet, the function of these distant ESCRT homologs is mostly unresolved. Here we show that Asgard ESCRT-III proteins of the Lokiarcheota self-assemble into helical filaments, a hallmark of the ESCRT system. We determined the cryo-EM structure of the filaments at 3.6 Å resolution and found that they share features of bacterial and eukaryotic ESCRT-III assemblies. Markedly, Asgard ESCRT-III filaments bound and deformed eukaryotic-like membrane vesicles. Oligonucleotides facilitated the assembly of ESCRT-III filaments and tuned the extent of membrane remodeling. The ability of Asgard archaeal ESCRTs to remodel eukaryotic-like membranes, which are fundamentally different from archaeal membranes, and the structural properties of these proteins places them at the junction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

abstract: Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, crucial for malignant transformation and metastasis. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and prostate cancer exhibit similar metabolic adaptations, particularly in glucose and lipid metabolism. Understanding this metabolic plasticity is crucial for identifying mechanisms contributing to metastasis. This review considers glucose and lipid metabolism in CLL and prostate cancer, exploring their roles in healthy and malignant states and during disease progression. In CLL, lipid metabolism supports cell survival and migration, with aggressive disease characterised by increased fatty acid oxidation and altered sphingolipids. Richter's transformation and aggressive lymphoma, however, exhibit a metabolic shift towards increased glycolysis. Similarly, prostate cell metabolism is unique, relying on citrate production in the healthy state and undergoing metabolic reprogramming during malignant transformation. Early-stage prostate cancer cells increase lipid synthesis and uptake, and decrease glycolysis, whereas metastatic cells re-adopt glucose metabolism, likely driven by interactions with the tumour microenvironment. Genetic drivers including TP53 and ATM mutations connect metabolic alterations to disease severity in these two malignancies. The bone microenvironment supports the metabolic demands of these malignancies, serving as an initiation niche for CLL and a homing site for prostate cancer metastases. By comparing these malignancies, this review underscores the importance of metabolic plasticity in cancer progression and highlights how CLL and prostate cancer may be models of circulating and solid tumours more broadly. The metabolic phenotypes throughout cancer cell transformation and metastasis, and the microenvironment in which these processes occur, present opportunities for interventions that could disrupt metastatic processes and improve patient outcomes.

abstract: To investigate the potential of an MRI-based radiomic model in distinguishing malignant prostate cancer (PCa) nodules from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-, as well as determining the incremental value of radiomic features to clinical variables, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score. A restrospective analysis was performed on a total of 251 patients (training cohort, n = 119; internal validation cohort, n = 52; and external validation cohort, n = 80) with prostatic nodules who underwent biparametric MRI at two hospitals between January 2018 and December 2020. A total of 1130 radiomic features were extracted from each MRI sequence, including shape-based features, gray-level histogram-based features, texture features, and wavelet features. The clinical model was constructed using logistic regression analysis. Radiomic models were created by comparing seven machine learning classifiers. The useful clinical variables and radiomic signature were integrated to develop the combined model. Model performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, decision curve, and clinical impact curve. The ratio of free PSA to total PSA, PSA density, peripheral zone volume, and PI-RADS score were independent determinants of malignancy. The clinical model based on these factors achieved an AUC of 0.814 (95% CI: 0.763-0.865) and 0.791 (95% CI: 0.742-840) in the internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. The clinical-radiomic nomogram yielded the highest accuracy, with an AUC of 0.925 (95% CI: 0.894-0.956) and 0.872 (95% CI: 0.837-0.907) in the internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. DCA and CIC further confirmed the clinical usefulness of the nomogram. Biparametric MRI-based radiomics has the potential to noninvasively discriminate between-BPH and malignant PCa nodules, which outperforms screening strategies based on PSA and PI-RADS.

abstract: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease whose pathogenesis is not fully understood to date. One of the suggested mechanisms for its development is NETosis, which involves the release of a specific network consisting of chromatin, proteins, and enzymes from neutrophils, stimulating the immune system. One of its markers is citrullinated histone H3 (H3Cit). This study aimed to evaluate the correlation of H3Cit levels with the clinical characteristics of 80 SLE patients. Levels of H3Cit in the subjects' serum were quantified spectrophotometrically. Statistical analysis was performed using MedCalc 15.8 and Statistica 13.3. Significantly higher H3Cit levels were found in patients with arthralgia (medians [interquartile range] [IQR]: 1.67 [1.67-1.69] vs. 1.67 [1.62-1.68], p = 0.0150, respectively) and reduced complement component C4 levels compared to patients without these conditions (medians [IQR]: 1.68 [1.67-1.70] vs. 1.68 [1.67-1.69], p = 0.0297, respectively). A significant weak negative correlation was observed between H3Cit levels and leukocytosis (rho = -0.2602, p = 0.0309) and reduced complement component C3 levels (rho = -0.2442, p = 0.0447) and a weak positive correlation with anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels (rho = 0.3794, p = 0.0036). Moreover, the clinical utility of the H3Cit assay in differentiating patients with arthralgia (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.709, p = 0.0115), seizures (AUC = 0.813, p = 0.0005), hepatomegaly (AUC = 0.746, p = 0.0111), and reduced levels of complement component C4 (AUC = 0.662, p = 0.0224) and without the above conditions was noted.

abstract: Genetic studies of the metabolome can uncover enzymatic and transport processes shaping human metabolism. Using rare variant aggregation testing based on whole-exome sequencing data to detect genes associated with levels of 1,294 plasma and 1,396 urine metabolites, we discovered 235 gene-metabolite associations, many previously unreported. Complementary approaches (genetic, computational (in silico gene knockouts in whole-body models of human metabolism) and one experimental proof of principle) provided orthogonal evidence that studies of rare, damaging variants in the heterozygous state permit inferences concordant with those from inborn errors of metabolism. Allelic series of functional variants in transporters responsible for transcellular sulfate reabsorption (SLC13A1, SLC26A1) exhibited graded effects on plasma sulfate and human height and pinpointed alleles associated with increased odds of diverse musculoskeletal traits and diseases in the population. This integrative approach can identify new players in incompletely characterized human metabolic reactions and reveal metabolic readouts informative of human traits and diseases.

abstract: Sepsis often leads to vasoplegia and a hyperdynamic cardiac state, with treatment focused on restoring vascular tone. However, sepsis can also cause reversible myocardial dysfunction, particularly in the elderly with pre-existing heart conditions. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recommend using dobutamine with norepinephrine or epinephrine alone for patients with septic shock with cardiac dysfunction and persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate fluid resuscitation and stable blood pressure. However, the definition of cardiac dysfunction and hypoperfusion in these guidelines remains controversial, leading to varied clinical interpretations. Cardiac dysfunction with persistent hypoperfusion despite restoring adequate preload and afterload is often considered a cardiogenic shock. Therefore, sepsis complicated by new-onset myocardial dysfunction or worsening of underlying myocardial dysfunction due to sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, resulting in cardiogenic shock, can be defined as "Sepsis-induced cardiogenic shock (SICS)". SICS is known to be associated with significantly higher mortality. A history of cardiac dysfunction is a strong predictor of SICS, highlighting the need for precise diagnosis and management given the aging population and rising cardiovascular disease prevalence. Therefore, SICS might benefit from early invasive hemodynamic monitoring with a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC), unlike those with septic shock alone. While routine PAC monitoring for all septic patients is impractical, echocardiography could be a useful screening tool for high-risk individuals. If echocardiography indicates cardiogenic shock, PAC might be warranted for continuous monitoring. The role of inotropes in SICS remains uncertain. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) might be considered for severe cases, as high-dose vasopressors and inotropes are associated with worse outcomes. Correct patient selection is the key to improving outcomes with MCS. Engaging a cardiogenic shock team for a multidisciplinary approach can be beneficial. In summary, addressing the evidence gaps in SICS diagnosis and management is crucial. Echocardiography for screening, advanced monitoring with PAC, and careful patient selection for MCS are important for optimal patient care.

abstract: Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) in blood encompass DNA, RNA, and protein biomarkers, but clinical utility is limited by their rarity. To enable tumor epitope-agnostic interrogation of large blood volumes, we developed a high-throughput microfluidic device, depleting hematopoietic cells through high-flow channels and force-amplifying magnetic lenses. Here, we apply this technology to analyze patient-derived leukapheresis products, interrogating a mean blood volume of 5.83 liters from seven patients with metastatic cancer. High CTC yields (mean 10,057 CTCs per patient; range 100 to 58,125) reveal considerable intra-patient heterogeneity. CTC size varies within patients, with 67% overlapping in diameter with WBCs. Paired single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing identifies subclonal patterns of aneuploidy and distinct signaling pathways within CTCs. In prostate cancers, a subpopulation of small aneuploid cells lacking epithelial markers is enriched for neuroendocrine signatures. Pooling of CNV-confirmed CTCs enables whole exome sequencing with high mutant allele fractions. High-throughput CTC enrichment thus enables cell-based liquid biopsy for comprehensive monitoring of cancer.

abstract: The inflammasome plays multifaceted roles in cancer, but less is known about its function during premalignancy upon initial cell transformation. We report a homeostatic function of the inflammasome in suppressing malignant transformation through Ras inhibition. We identified increased hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation within the bone marrow of inflammasome-deficient mice. HSCs within an inflammasome-deficient stroma expressed a Ras signature associated with increased Ras pathway- and cancer-related transcripts and heightened levels of cytokine, chemokine and growth factor receptors. Stromal inflammasome deficiency established a poised Ras-dependent mitogenic state within HSCs, which fueled progeny B cell lymphomagenesis upon Myc deregulation in a spontaneous model of B cell lymphoma, and shortened its premalignant stage leading to faster onset of malignancy. Thus, the stromal inflammasome preserves tissue balance by restraining Ras to disrupt the most common oncogenic Myc-Ras cooperation and establish a natural defense against transition to malignancy. These findings should inform preventative therapies against hematological malignancies.

abstract: A balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation is required to maintain concurrent proliferation and cellular diversification in organoids; however, this has proven difficult in homogeneous cultures devoid of in vivo spatial niche gradients for adult stem cell-derived organoids. In this study, we leverage a combination of small molecule pathway modulators to enhance the stemness of organoid stem cells, thereby amplifying their differentiation potential and subsequently increasing cellular diversity within human intestinal organoids without the need for artificial spatial or temporal signaling gradients. Moreover, we demonstrate that this balance between self-renewal and differentiation can be effectively and reversibly shifted from secretory cell differentiation to the enterocyte lineage with enhanced proliferation using BET inhibitors, or unidirectional differentiation towards specific intestinal cell types by manipulating in vivo niche signals such as Wnt, Notch, and BMP. As a result, we establish an optimized human small intestinal organoid (hSIO) system characterized by high proliferative capacity and increased cell diversity under a single culture condition. This optimization facilitates the scalability and utility of the organoid system in high-throughput applications.

abstract: The presence of redox-active molecules containing catenated sulfur atoms (supersulfides) in living organisms has led to a review of the concepts of redox biology and its translational strategy. Glutathione (GSH) is the body's primary detoxifier and antioxidant, and its oxidized form (GSSG) has been considered as a marker of oxidative status. However, we report that GSSG, but not reduced GSH, prevents ischemic supersulfide catabolism-associated heart failure in male mice by electrophilic modification of dynamin-related protein (Drp1). In healthy exercised hearts, the redox-sensitive Cys644 of Drp1 is highly S-glutathionylated. Nearly 40% of Cys644 is normally polysulfidated, which is a preferential target for GSSG-mediated S-glutathionylation. Cys644 S-glutathionylation is resistant to Drp1 depolysulfidation-dependent mitochondrial hyperfission and myocardial dysfunction caused by hypoxic stress. MD simulation of Drp1 structure and site-directed mutagenetic analysis reveal a functional interaction between Cys644 and a critical phosphorylation site Ser637, through Glu640. Bulky modification at Cys644 via polysulfidation or S-glutathionylation reduces Drp1 activity by disrupting Ser637-Glu640-Cys644 interaction. Disruption of Cys644 S-glutathionylation nullifies the cardioprotective effect of GSSG against heart failure after myocardial infarction. Our findings suggest a therapeutic potential of supersulfide-based Cys bulking on Drp1 for ischemic heart disease.

abstract: Each human genome has approximately 5 million DNA variants. Even for complete loss-of-function variants causing inherited, monogenic diseases, current understanding based on gene-specific molecular function does not adequately predict variability observed between people with identical mutations or fluctuating disease trajectories. We present a parallel paradigm for loss-of-function variants based on broader consequences to the cell when aberrant polypeptide chains of amino acids are translated from mutant RNA to generate mutated proteins. Missense variants that modify primary amino acid sequence, and nonsense/frameshift variants that generate premature termination codons (PTCs), are placed in context alongside emergent themes of chaperone binding, protein quality control capacity, and cellular adaptation to stress. Relatively stable proteostasis burdens are contrasted with rapid changes after induction of gene expression, or stress responses that suppress nonsense mediated decay (NMD) leading to higher PTC transcript levels where mutant proteins can augment cellular stress. For known disease-causal mutations, an adjunctive variant categorization system enhances clinical predictive power and precision therapeutic opportunities. Additionally, with typically more than 100 nonsense and frameshift variants, and ∼10,000 missense variants per human DNA, the paradigm focuses attention on all protein-coding DNA variants, and their potential contributions to multimorbid states beyond classically designated inherited diseases. Experimental testing in clinically relevant systems is encouraged to augment current atlases of protein expression at single-cell resolution, and high-throughput experimental data and deep-learning models that predict which amino acid substitutions generate enhanced degradative burdens. Incorporating additional dimensions such as pan-proteome competition for chaperones, and age-related loss of proteostasis capacity, should further accelerate health impacts.

abstract: The neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been thought to be involved in the development of some types of cancer. Yet, the de novo synthesis of GABA and how it functions in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Here, we report that SLC6A12 acts as a transporter of GABA, and that aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 family member A1 (ALDH9A1), not glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1), generates GABA in human HCC. Interestingly, SLC6A12 and ALDH9A1 are upregulated during lung metastases of HCC, and depletion of either of them leads to impaired HCC metastasis. Mechanistically, GABA directly binds and stabilizes β-catenin, resulting in activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and thereby enhancing HCC metastasis. Reciprocally, β-catenin transcriptionally upregulates SLC6A12 to import more GABA to stabilize β-catenin. Thus, our findings identify ALDH9A1 as the major GABA synthetase in HCC, demonstrate a positive-feedback regulatory mechanism for sustaining Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and reveal a role for β-catenin in sensing GABA, which contributes to HCC metastasis.

abstract: Sacubitril/valsartan, a first-in-class angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor, is widely used to treat heart failure. Despite its efficacy, sacubitril/valsartan inevitably causes adverse events such as hypotension, renal dysfunction, hyperkalemia, and angioedema. Sacubitril/valsartan-associated ototoxicity is often underreported in clinical studies and real-world settings. This study aimed to systematically characterize ototoxicity profiles using post-marketing data. Disproportionality analysis was performed using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 2015 to 2023. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information components (IC) were used to detect potential ototoxicity associated with sacubitril/valsartan. Significant signals were defined as ROR025 > 1 and IC025 > 0 in at least three reports. From 272,790 reports on sacubitril/valsartan and 10,798 (4.0%) reports on ototoxicity, sacubitril/valsartan and ototoxicity showed significant association (IC025 = 1.57; ROR025 = 2.99). Dizziness, hypoacusis, balance disorder, and deafness were detected as positive signals; hypoacusis was the strongest (IC025 = 3.21; ROR025 = 9.29). Median time to onset was 45 (10-99) days, and 62.4% of ototoxicity events occurred within 90 days of sacubitril/valsartan administration. Hospitalization accounted for 32.5% of ototoxic outcomes, while life-threatening events, death, and disabling accounted for only 3.9%, 3.4%, and 2.0%, respectively. Sacubitril/valsartan treatment increased ototoxicity risks. Therefore, promptly identifying and treating sacubitril/valsartan-related ototoxicity is critical.

abstract: Glioblastoma is immunologically "cold" and resistant to single-agent immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Our previous study of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in surgically-accessible recurrent glioblastoma identified a molecular signature of response to ICI and suggested that neoadjuvant pembrolizumab may improve survival. To increase the power of this observation, we enrolled an additional 25 patients with a primary endpoint of evaluating the cell cycle gene signature associated with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab and performed bulk-RNA seq on resected tumor tissue (NCT02852655). Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab was associated with suppression of cell cycle/cancer proliferation genes and upregulation of T-cell/interferon-related gene expression. This signature was unique to patients treated with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab and was an independent positive risk factor for survival. Our results demonstrate a clear pharmacodynamic effect of anti-PD1 therapy in glioblastoma and identify pathways that may mediate resistance. However, we did not confirm a survival benefit to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in recurrent glioblastoma and our secondary endpoint of PFS-6 was 19.5% (95% CI: 9.29-41.2%) for the pooled neoadjuvant cohorts. Our new data suggests some patients may exhibit innate resistance to pre-surgical ICI and require other concomitant therapies to sensitize effectively.

abstract: Here we report results of a phase 1 multi-institutional, open-label, dose-escalation trial (NCT02744287) of BPX-601, an investigational autologous PSCA-directed GoCAR-T® cell product containing an inducible MyD88/CD40 ON-switch responsive to the activating dimerizer rimiducid, in patients with metastatic pancreatic (mPDAC) or castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Primary objectives were to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine the recommended phase 2 dose/schedule (RP2D). Secondary objectives included the assessment of efficacy and characterization of the pharmacokinetics of rimiducid. Thirty-three patients received BPX-601 with or without rimiducid, 24 patients with mPDAC and 9 with mCRPC. Two dose-limiting toxicities and two treatment-related deaths occurred in the highest-dose mCRPC cohort, after which the study was terminated, without determination of the RP2D. Two mCRPC patients experienced partial responses (one unconfirmed), and 56% of mCRPC patients achieved ≥50% reduction in prostate-specific antigen. BPX-601 cell expansion, long-term persistence in peripheral blood, and tumor infiltration were observed. Rimiducid increased circulating inflammatory cytokines/chemokines consistent with GoCAR-T® cell activation. These results suggest that pharmacological activation of GoCAR-T® cells is feasible and may offer a promising avenue to control chimeric antigen receptor-T cell activity with continued dose-optimization to improve tolerability.

abstract: Gastric cancer (GC), one of the most common and heterogeneous malignancies, is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide and is closely related to dietary habits. Fatty acid is one of the main nutrients of human beings, which is closely related to diabetes, hypertension and other diseases. However, the correlation between fatty acid metabolism and the development and progression of GC remains largely unknown. Here, we profiled the genetic alterations of fatty acid anabolism-related genes (FARGs) in gastric cancer samples from the TCGA cohort and GEO database to evaluate the possible relationships and their internal regulatory mechanism. Through consistent clustering and functional enrichment analysis, three distinct fatty acid anabolism clusters and three gene subtypes were identified to participate in different biological pathways, and correlated with the characteristics of immune cell infiltration and clinical prognosis. Importantly, a distinctive FA-score was constructed through the principal component analysis to quantify the characteristics of fatty acid anabolism in each GC patient. Further analysis showed patients grouped in the high FA-score group were characterized with greater tumor mutational burden (TMB) and higher microsatellite stability (MSI-H), which may be more aeschynomenous to immunotherapy and had a favorable prognosis. Altogether, our bioinformatics analysis based on FARGs uncovered the potential roles of fatty acid metabolism in GC, and may provide newly prognostic information and novel approaches for promoting individualized immunotherapy in patients with GC.

abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, and the vast majority of cases occur in elderly patients. Recently, the accumulation of Aβ and tau proteins has drawn considerable attention in AD research. This review explores the multifaceted interactions between these proteins and their contribution to the pathological landscape of AD, encompassing synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and PANoptosis. PANoptosis is a collective term for programmed cell death (PCD) modalities that encompass elements of apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. The accumulation of Aβ peptides and tau proteins, along with the immune response in brain cells, may trigger PANoptosis, thus advancing the progression of the disease. Recent advancements in molecular imaging and genetics have provided deeper insights into the interactions between Aβ peptides, tau proteins, and the immune response. The review also discusses the role of mitochondrial dysregulation in AD. The exploration of the interplay between neurodegeneration, immune responses, and cell death offers promising avenues for the development of innovative treatments.

abstract: Previous observational studies have reported inconsistent associations between nut consumption and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This study aims to identify the causal relationship between different types of nuts consumption and CVD, and to quantify the potential mediating effects of cardiometabolic factors. We utilized Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) data to assess the causal effects of nut consumption on CVD using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) and a two-step MR analysis. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method indicated that processed (salted or roasted) peanuts were potentially and positively associated with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (OR 1.4866; 95%CI 1.0491-2.1065). No causal relationships were found between nuts consumption and other CVD outcomes, including atrial fibrillation, angina, coronary atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, IHD, myocardial infarction, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral haemorrhage and stroke. Both MR-Egger and median-based methods yielded similar results to IVW. Furthermore, in the two-step MR analysis, fasting insulin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and fasting blood glucose were identified as mediators in the potential causal relationship between processed peanuts and IHD, explaining 16.98%, 6.38% and 4.91% of the mediation, respectively. In total, these mediators accounted for 28.27% of the association between salted or roasted peanuts and IHD.

abstract: Breast cancer will overtake all other cancers in terms of diagnoses in 2024. Breast cancer counts highest among women in terms of cancer incidence and death rates. Innovative treatment approaches are desperately needed because treatment resistance brought on by current clinical drugs impedes therapeutic efficacy. The T cell-based immunotherapy known as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell treatment, which uses the patient's immune cells to fight cancer, has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in treating hematologic malignancies; nevertheless, the treatment effects in solid tumors, like breast cancer, have not lived up to expectations. We discuss in detail the role of tumor-associated antigens in breast cancer, current clinical trials, barriers to the intended therapeutic effects of CAR-T cell therapy, and potential ways to increase treatment efficacy. Finally, our review aims to stimulate readers' curiosity by summarizing the most recent advancements in CAR-T cell therapy for breast cancer.

abstract: The major limiting factor of photosynthesis in C3 plants is the enzyme, rubisco which inadequately distinguishes between carbon dioxide and oxygen. To overcome catalytic deficiencies of Rubisco, cyanobacteria utilize advanced protein microcompartments, called the carboxysomes which envelopes the enzymes, Rubisco and Carbonic Anhydrase (CA). These microcompartments facilitate the diffusion of bicarbonate ions which are converted to CO2 by CA, following in an increase in carbon flux near Rubisco boosting CO2 fixation process. Inspired by this mechanism, our study aims to improve photosynthetic efficiency in the C3 model crop, rice (Oryza sativa), by stably engineering the genetic components of the β-carboxysome of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (hereafter, Syn7942) in the rice genome. We demonstrated this proof of concept by developing two types of transgenic rice plants. The first type involved targeting the chloroplasts with three key carboxysome structural proteins (ccmL, ccmO, and ccmK) and a chimeric protein (ccmC), which integrates domains from four distinct carboxysome proteins. The second type combined these proteins with the introduction of cyanobacterial Rubisco targeted to chloroplasts. Additionally, in the second transgenic background, RNA interference was employed to silence the endogenous rice Rubisco along with stromal carbonic anhydrase gene. The transgenic plants exhibited the assembly of carboxysome-like compartments and aggregated proteins in the chloroplasts and the second type demonstrated reduced plant growth and yield. We have followed a bottom-up approach for targeting the cyanobacterial CCM in rice chloroplast which would help in stacking up the components further required for increasing the photosynthetic efficiency in future.

abstract: Although promising, dendritic cell (DC) vaccines may not suffice to fully inhibit tumor progression alone, mainly due to the short expression time of the antigen in DC vaccines, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and tumor antigenic modulation. Overcoming the limitations of DC vaccines is expected to further enhance their anti-tumor effects. In this study, we constructed a circRNA-loaded DC vaccine utilizing the inherent stability of circular RNA to enhance the expression level and duration of the antigen within the DC vaccine. Meanwhile we combined it with gemcitabine and validated their therapeutic efficacy in the Panc02 tumor model. We found that the use of DC vaccine alone can reach a tumor inhibition rate of 69%, and the effect was further enhanced when combined with gemcitabine, reaching a tumor inhibition rate of 89%. The combined treatment achieved a synergistic effect, which not only reduced immunosuppressive Tregs but also induced immunogenic cell death, leading to antigen spreading and reducing immune evasion caused by tumor antigenic modulation. As a result, the survival of the mice was significantly prolonged. Our research provides a promising approach for the clinical treatment of pancreatic cancer.

abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent malignant tumor worldwide, with a high mortality rate due to its complex etiology and limited early screening techniques. This study aimed to identify potential biomarkers for early detection of CRC utilizing targeted metabolite profiling of platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Based on multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis identified metabolites in PRP collected from patients with CRC (n = 70) and healthy controls (n = 30). A total of 302 metabolites were identified and quantified in this study, including various categories such as lipids, lipid mediators, amino acids, and derivatives, organic acids and derivatives, nucleotides and derivatives, alkaloids, carbohydrates, vitamins and derivatives, and others. The differential analysis revealed that five carbohydrates and organic acids (lactose, glycerol-3-phosphate, 2-hydroxyglutaric acid, isocitric acid, and citric acid) involved in the carbohydrate metabolism pathway displayed consistent upregulation within PRP derived from patients with CRC. To further validate the abundance of differential metabolites, 10 pairs of CRC tissues, adjacent tissues, and matched PRP were collected. Ultimately, five carbohydrate metabolites were validated in PRP, and compared with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA199), the five carbohydrate metabolites significantly improved the specificity of differentiating patients with CRC from healthy controls. Furthermore, the diagnostic efficacy of the combined five-carbohydrate metabolite panel was superior to that of individual metabolites, CEA and CA199. The sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of the metabolite panel in distinguishing patients with CRC from healthy controls were 90.00%, 96.67%, and 0.961 (95% CI 0.922-0.998), respectively. Collectively, metabolomics was used to identify and validate differential metabolites in the PRP of CRC, which may serve as potential early screening markers for patients with CRC.

abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) affects 537 million people as of 2021, and is projected to rise to 783 million by 2045. This positions DM as the ninth leading cause of death globally. Among DM patients, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. Notably, the prevalence rates of CVD is alarmingly high among diabetic individuals, particularly in North America and the Caribbean (46.0%), and Southeast Asia (42.5%). The predominant form of CVD among diabetic patients is coronary artery disease (CAD), accounting for 29.4% of cases. The pathophysiology of DM is complex, involving insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction, and associated cardiovascular complications including diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN). These conditions exacerbate CVD risks underscoring the importance of managing key risk factors including hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and genetic predisposition. Understanding the genetic networks and molecular processes that link diabetes and cardiovascular disease can lead to new diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. Imeglimin, a novel mitochondrial bioenergetic enhancer, represents a promising medication for diabetes with the potential to address both insulin resistance and secretion difficulties. Effective diabetes management through oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) can protect the cardiovascular system. Additionally, certain antihypertensive medications can significantly reduce the risk of diabetes-related CVD. Additionally, lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise are vital in managing diabesity and reducing CVD risks. These interventions, along with emerging therapeutic agents and ongoing clinical trials, offer hope for improved patient outcomes and long-term DM remission. This study highlights the urgent need for management strategies to address the overlapping epidemics of DM and CVD. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms and risk factors, this study aims to guide future perspectives and enhance understanding of the pathogenesis of CVD complications in patients with DM, thereby guiding more effective treatment strategies.

abstract: Introduction:
        
      
      Sarcopenia and Osteoporosis are two prevalent conditions in the older population and are defined by low strength, muscle quality/volume and low Bone Mineral Density, respectively. When there is a concomitant presence of both, there is a novel musculoskeletal condition called Osteosarcopenia. These conditions adversely affect quality of life and elevate the risk of fractures, disability, and mortality among older individuals. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is the impairment of the mutualistic relationship between microorganisms, metabolic products and the host's immune system. Gut microbiota dysbiosis could be intricately linked to sarcopenia and osteoporosis, shedding light on the complex microbiota-gut-bone-muscle axis. Furthermore, the intestinal microbiota experiences a notable decline in beneficial microorganisms as part of the aging process. The relationship between dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota in older people and sarcopenia, osteoporosis or osteosarcopenia is still unclear. This review protocol aims to systematically review the literature and compile evidence on the influence of gut microbiota dysbiosis on musculoskeletal function in older people with sarcopenia, osteoporosis or osteosarcopenia.

abstract: Myosin-VIIA (MYO7A) is an unconventional myosin responsible for syndromic (Usher 1B) or nonsyndromic forms of deafness in humans when mutated. In the cochlea, MYO7A is expressed in hair cells, where it is believed to act as the motor protein tensioning the mechanoelectrical transducer (MET) channels, thus setting their resting open probability (Po). However, direct evidence for this unique role for an unconventional myosin in mature hair cells is lacking. Here, we show that MYO7A has a distinct role in hair cells, being crucial for the structural integrity of hair bundles. Postnatal deletion of Myo7a leads to 87 to 96% reduction in MYO7A from hair cells by postnatal day 20 (P20), without affecting hearing function. During the following week, mice showed progressive decline in both hearing function and MET current amplitude in hair cells without affecting the resting Po and calcium sensitivity of the MET channel. Hair-bundle stiffness was normal at P20 but halved at P30, despite it having a normal staircase morphology and tip links. The reduction of MYO7A in the stereocilia (>87%) increased their vulnerability to sound-induced damage, with significantly more hearing loss and hair bundle deterioration than in control mice. RNA-sequencing identified a downregulation of several stereociliary genes in the Myo7a-deficient cochlea, indicating the presence of indirect compensatory mechanisms. This study reveals that mature hair cells seem to use a MYO7A-independent mechanism to maintain the resting Po of the MET channels. Instead, MYO7A is essential for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the hair bundles.

abstract: There are hundreds of rare syndromic diseases involving hearing loss, many of which are not targeted for clinical genetic testing. We systematically explored the genetic causes of undiagnosed syndromic hearing loss using a combination of whole exome sequencing (WES) and a phenotype similarity search system called PubCaseFinder. Fifty-five families with syndromic hearing loss of unknown cause were analyzed using WES after prescreening of several deafness genes depending on patient clinical features. Causative genes were identified in 22 families, including both established genes associated with syndromic hearing loss (PTPN11, CHD7, KARS1, OPA1, DLX5, MITF, SOX10, MYO7A, and USH2A) and those associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss (STRC, EYA4, and KCNQ4). Association of a DLX5 variant with incomplete partition type I (IP-I) anomaly of the inner ear was identified in a patient with cleft lip and palate and acetabular dysplasia. The study identified COL1A1, CFAP52, and NSD1 as causative genes through phenotype similarity search or by analogy. ZBTB10 was proposed as a novel candidate gene for syndromic hearing loss with IP-I. A mouse model with homozygous Zbtb10 frameshift variant resulted in embryonic lethality, suggesting the importance of this gene for early embryonic development. Our data highlight a wide spectrum of rare causative genes in patients with syndromic hearing loss, and demonstrate that WES analysis combined with phenotype similarity search is a valuable approach for clinical genetic testing of undiagnosed disease.

abstract: Donafenib is an improved version of sorafenib in which deuterium is substituted into the drug's chemical structure, enhancing its stability and antitumor activity. Donafenib exhibits enhanced antitumor activity and better tolerance than sorafenib in preclinical and clinical studies. However, the specific mechanism of its effect on hepatocellular carcinoma has not been reported. Iron deposition is a cell death pattern caused by disturbances in iron metabolism. Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death. They may interact with each other during cell death. This study mainly explores the potential mechanism of donafenib activating the p53 signaling pathway, inducing iron deposition, and enhancing cell apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepa1-6 and Huh7 cells were treated with various concentrations of donafenib. Scratch healing and pore migration tests were conducted. Analyze apoptosis through flow cytometry and TUNEL fluorescence labeling. RNA sequencing was conducted on both untreated and donafenib-treated Huh7 cells. The key proteins involved in ferroptosis (SLC7A11, GPX4) and apoptosis (caspase3, caspase8, Bax, Bcl-2, p53) were then evaluated using immunoblotting and immunohistochemical staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the cancer cells were measured. Donafenib treatment resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities of cancer cells. There was an increase in apoptosis rates and ROS accumulation, and a reduction in tumor volume. The key proteins involved in ferroptosis and apoptosis underwent significant changes. Donafenib activates the p53 signaling pathway, induce ferroptosis, and enhance apoptosis, suggesting its potential as an effective therapeutic agent for HCC.

abstract: Hibernating brown bears, due to a drastic reduction in metabolic rate, show only moderate muscle wasting. Here, we evaluate if ATPase activity of resting skeletal muscle myosin can contribute to this energy sparing. By analyzing single muscle fibers taken from the same bears, either during hibernation or in summer, we find that fibers from hibernating bears have a mild decline in force production and a significant reduction in ATPase activity. Single fiber proteomics, western blotting, and immunohistochemical analyses reveal major remodeling of the mitochondrial proteome during hibernation. Furthermore, using bioinformatical approaches and western blotting we find that phosphorylated myosin light chain, a known stimulator of basal myosin ATPase activity, is decreased in hibernating and disused muscles. These results suggest that skeletal muscle limits energy loss by reducing myosin ATPase activity, indicating a possible role for myosin ATPase activity modulation in multiple muscle wasting conditions.

abstract: The presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) contributes to the development of cervical lesions and cervical cancer. Recent studies suggest that an imbalance in the cervicovaginal microbiota might be a factor in the persistence of HR-HPV infections. In this study, we collected 156 cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) of women with HR-HPV infection, which were divided into three groups (negative for intraepithelial lesions = 78, low/high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions = 52/26). We performed metabolomics and 16 S rRNA sequencing to identify changes in metabolites and cervicovaginal microbiota among patients with HR-HPV infection and varying grades of cervical lesions. We detected 164 metabolites and 389 flora types in the three groups. Ten CVF metabolites-N-methylalanine, phenylacetaldehyde, succinic acid, 2-3-dihydroxypyridine, DL-p-hydroxylphenyllactic acid, gluconic acid lactone, guanine, glucose-6-phosphate, erythrose, and sucrose showed significant associations with disease severity and distinct separation patterns in HR-HPV-infected patients with LSIL and HSIL, with an area under the curve of 0.928. The most abundant microbial communities in the CVF were Gardnerella. Gardnerella was found to be associated with increased levels of succinic acid, thereby highlighting distinct metabolic profiles. These findings suggest that the development of cervical lesions resulting from persistent HR-HPV infection is associated with significant alterations in systemic metabolism and shifts in the cervicovaginal microbiota, providing valuable insights into the metabolic and microbiota changes linked to disease severity.

abstract: Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (aSAH), resulting from ruptured aneurysms, is a major contributor to stroke-related mortality and morbidity. Despite advances in healthcare, aSAH remains severe and often leads to complications such as cerebral vasospasm (CV), cerebral infarction, and delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DIND). Clazosentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, has demonstrated potential in alleviating vasospasm and its associated outcomes, although evidence of its efficacy remains unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared clazosentan with placebo in adult patients with aSAH. Primary outcomes were vasospasm-related cerebral infarction and DIND. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of vasospasm, mortality, and adverse effects. Data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.3, and meta-regression was employed to assess moderators, including aneurysm treatment modality. Eight RCTs, involving 3,186 participants, were included in the analysis. Clazosentan significantly reduced vasospasm-related cerebral infarction (RR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.42-0.76, p = 0.0002) and DIND (RR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.55-0.80, p < 0.0001). Dosages of 10 mg and 15 mg were found to be the most effective. However, clazosentan had no effect on the overall mortality (p = 0.48) and was associated with an increased risk of hypotension, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusion. Clazosentan significantly reduced vasospasm-related cerebral infarction and DIND in patients with aSAH, particularly at higher doses. Nonetheless, its use is linked to notable adverse effects, highlighting the need for careful assessment of its risk-benefit profile in clinical practice.

abstract: Nuclear speckles are membraneless organelles that associate with active transcription sites and participate in post-transcriptional mRNA processing. During the cell cycle, nuclear speckles dissolve following phosphorylation of their protein components. Here, we identify the PP1 family as the phosphatases that counteract kinase-mediated dissolution. PP1 overexpression increases speckle cohesion and leads to retention of mRNA within speckles and the nucleus. Using APEX2 proximity labeling combined with RNA-sequencing, we characterize the recruitment of specific RNAs. We find that many transcripts are preferentially enriched within nuclear speckles compared to the nucleoplasm, particularly chromatin- and nucleus-associated transcripts. While total polyadenylated RNA retention increases with nuclear speckle cohesion, the ratios of most mRNA species to each other are constant, indicating non-selective retention. We further find that cellular responses to heat shock, oxidative stress, and hypoxia include changes to the phosphorylation and cohesion of nuclear speckles and to mRNA retention. Our results demonstrate that tuning the material properties of nuclear speckles provides a mechanism for the acute control of mRNA localization.

abstract: Aging of the brain vasculature plays a key role in the development of neurovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, thereby contributing to cognitive impairment. Among other factors, DNA damage strongly promotes cellular aging, however, the role of genomic instability in brain endothelial cells (EC) and its potential effect on brain homeostasis is still largely unclear. We here investigated how endothelial aging impacts blood-brain barrier (BBB) function by using excision repair cross complementation group 1 (ERCC1)-deficient human brain ECs and an EC-specific Ercc1 knock out (EC-KO) mouse model. In vitro, ERCC1-deficient brain ECs displayed increased senescence-associated secretory phenotype expression, reduced BBB integrity, and higher sprouting capacities due to an underlying dysregulation of the Dll4-Notch pathway. In line, EC-KO mice showed more P21+ cells, augmented expression of angiogenic markers, and a concomitant increase in the number of brain ECs and pericytes. Moreover, EC-KO mice displayed BBB leakage and enhanced cell adhesion molecule expression accompanied by peripheral immune cell infiltration into the brain. These findings were confined to the white matter, suggesting a regional susceptibility. Collectively, our results underline the role of endothelial aging as a driver of impaired BBB function, endothelial sprouting, and increased immune cell migration into the brain, thereby contributing to impaired brain homeostasis as observed during the aging process.

abstract: Epidemiological evidence connecting cooking fuel use to metabolic syndrome (MetS) is lacking. Solid cooking fuel usage and MetS prevalence were prospectively investigated in this study. We included participants in 2011 and 2015 from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) data. Through cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, we found that the use of solid fuels reduced the risk of MetS in participants compared with clean fuels (cross-sectional study: 2011: Odds ratio (OR): 0.819, 95 %confidence interval (CI): 0.747-0.897, P < 0.001; 2015: OR: 0.766, 95 %CI: 0.708-0.851, P < 0.001; longitudinal study: OR: 0.736, 95 %CI: 0.652-0.831, P < 0.001).This impact ceases to exist whenever a switch in fuel type occurs (Non persistent clean: OR: 0.937, 95 %CI: 0.837-1.050, P = 0.262; Persistent solid: OR: 0.767, 95 %CI: 0.691-0.853, P < 0.001). Moreover, we found that biomass (crop residue and wood burning) combustion reduced the prevalence of MetS (OR: 0.653, 95 %CI: 0.573-0.743, P < 0.001), while coal had no effect on the prevalence of MetS (OR: 1.092, 95 %CI: 0.907-1.315, P = 0.352). Based on mediation analysis, triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) cholesterol mediated 61.3 % and 39.8 % of the reduction in MetS prevalence observed with solid fuel. In summary, our research showed that household solid cooking fuels were associated with less MetS risk. Among them, biomass combustion may play an important role.

abstract: The placenta is the critical interface between mother and fetus, and consequently, placental dysfunction underlies many pregnancy complications. Placental formation requires an adequate expansion of trophoblast stem and progenitor cells followed by finely tuned lineage specification events. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse trophoblast stem cells during the earliest phases of differentiation, we identify gatekeepers of the stem cell state, notably Nicol1, and uncover unsuspected trajectories of cell lineage diversification as well as regulators of lineage entry points. We show that junctional zone precursors and precursors of one of the two syncytial layers of the mouse placental labyrinth, the Syncytiotrophoblast-I lineage, initially share similar trajectories. Importantly, our functional analysis of one such lineage precursor marker, CXADR, demonstrates that this cell surface protein regulates the differentiation dynamics between the two syncytial layers of the mouse labyrinth, ensuring the correct establishment of the placental exchange surface. Deciphering the mechanisms underlying trophoblast lineage specification will inform our understanding of human pregnancy in health and disease.

abstract: Chromosome instability is a prevalent vulnerability of cancer cells that has yet to be fully exploited therapeutically. To identify genes uniquely essential to chromosomally unstable cells, we mined the Cancer Dependency Map for genes essential in tumor cells with high levels of copy number aberrations. We identify and validate KIF18A, a mitotic kinesin, as a vulnerability of chromosomally unstable cancer cells. Knockdown of KIF18A leads to mitotic defects and reduction of tumor growth. Screening of a chemical library for inhibitors of KIF18A enzymatic activity identified a hit that was optimized to yield VLS-1272, which is orally bioavailable, potent, ATP non-competitive, microtubule-dependent, and highly selective for KIF18A versus other kinesins. Inhibition of KIF18A's ATPase activity prevents KIF18A translocation across the mitotic spindle, resulting in chromosome congression defects, mitotic cell accumulation, and cell death. Profiling VLS-1272 across >100 cancer cell lines demonstrates that the specificity towards cancer cells with chromosome instability differentiates KIF18A inhibition from other clinically tested anti-mitotic drugs. Treatment of tumor xenografts with VLS-1272 results in mitotic defects leading to substantial, dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth. The strong biological rationale, robust preclinical data, and optimized compound properties enable the clinical development of a KIF18A inhibitor in cancers with high chromosomal instability.

abstract: Cellular senescence plays a critical role in repeated ultraviolet (UV) exposure-induced skin photoaging. Currently, from the perspective of regulating senescent cells, potent compounds or reliable protein targets that could effectively prevent skin photoaging have not yet been reported. Herein, we demonstrated that chlorogenic acid (CGA) significantly inhibited UVA-induced senescence of human dermis skin fibroblasts (HDF) cells by screening the natural product library. The activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) result revealed that Enolase 1 (ENO1) is one of the direct targets of CGA in HDF cells. Further mechanism research indicated that CGA covalently binds to ENO1, and prevented UVA-induced cellular senescence by suppressing the activity of ENO1 protein to block the glycolytic pathway. Importantly, we found that CGA dose-dependently reduced the skin wrinkle score, alleviated skin pathological features and inhibited senescent characteristics in a photoaging mouse model. The proteomic analysis revealed that CGA treatment effectively inhibited senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) secretion and glycolysis in skin samples of mice. Collectively, our study not only demonstrated that inhibiting cell senescence is an effective anti-skin photoaging strategy, but also revealed that ENO1 is a promising protein target to prevent photoaging.

abstract: Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV), is one of the leading causes of severe visual impairment and irreversible vision loss around the world. Subretinal fibrosis (SRF) contributes to the incomplete response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment and is one of the main reasons for long-term poor visual outcomes in nAMD. Reducing SRF is urgently needed in the anti-VEGF era. The role of non-coding RNAs has been implicated in CNV; however, their roles in SRF have not been elucidated yet. Herein, we comprehensively investigated circular RNA (circRNA) profiles in the laser-induced mouse SRF model and the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) fibrosis model. A novel circRNA, circSIRT2, was identified, and its function in SRF and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) regulation was investigated. circSIRT2 was consistently upregulated in fibrotic models in vivo and in vitro. circSIRT2 overexpression downregulated the fibrotic markers and inhibited the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells in vitro. circSIRT2 overexpression in vivo also reduced SRF area in mice. Mechanistically, circSIRT2 functioned by sponging miR-542-3p, which further upregulated the expression of vasohibin-1 (VASH1) and reduced SRF lesion development. Vitreous delivery of miR-542-3p and VASH1 in the mouse SRF model also confirmed the pro-fibrotic function of miR-542-3p and anti-fibrotic function of VASH1, respectively. In conclusion, circSIRT2 inhibited SRF by binding miR-542-3p, which stimulated the VASH1 expression and subsequently suppressed EndMT. The circSIRT2/miR-542-3p/VASH1 axis may serve as a promising therapeutic target for SRF in nAMD.

abstract: Background: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating form of stroke with a lack of effective treatments. Following disease onset, ICH activates microglia and recruits peripheral leukocytes into the perihematomal region to amplify neural injury. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) controls the proliferation and survival of various myeloid cells and lymphocytes. However, the role of BTK in neuroinflammation and ICH injury remains poorly understood. Methods: Peripheral blood samples were collected from ICH patients and healthy controls to measure BTK expression profile in immune cell subsets. C57BL/6 mice were used to measure BTK expression and the activity of immune cell subsets following ICH induction. Neurological tests, brain water content, Evans blue leakage, MRI were used to assess the therapeutic effects of ibrutinib on ICH injury. Flow cytometry was used to investigate immune cell infiltration and microglial activity. Microglia were depleted using a CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622. Gr-1+ myeloid cells and B cells were depleted using monoclonal antibodies. Microglia-like BV2 cells were cultured to test the effects of BTK inhibition on these cells. Results: In humans and mice, we found that BTK was remarkably upregulated in myeloid cells after ICH. Inhibition of BTK using ibrutinib led to reduced neurological deficits, perihematomal edema, brain water content and blood-brain barrier disruption. BTK inhibition suppressed the inflammatory activity of microglia and brain infiltration of leukocytes. In contrast, BTK inhibition did not alter the counts of peripheral immune cells other than B cells. Further, the depletion of microglia or Gr-1+ myeloid cells ablated the protective effects of BTK inhibition against ICH injury. Notably, the depletion of B cells did not alter the protective effects of BTK inhibition against ICH injury. This suggests that the benefit of BTK inhibition in ICH mainly involves its impact on microglia and Gr-1+ myeloid cells. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that BTK inhibition attenuates neuroinflammation and ICH injury, which warrants further investigation as a potential therapy for ICH.

abstract: Current assays fail to address breast cancer's complex biology and accurately predict treatment response. On a retrospective cohort of 1082 female breast tissues, we develop and validate mFISHseq, which integrates multiplexed RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization with RNA-sequencing, guided by laser capture microdissection. This technique ensures tumor purity, unbiased whole transcriptome profiling, and explicitly quantifies intratumoral heterogeneity. Here we show mFISHseq has 93% accuracy compared to immunohistochemistry. Our consensus subtyping and risk groups mitigate single sample discordance, provide early and late prognostic information, and identify high risk patients with enriched immune signatures, which predict response to neoadjuvant immunotherapy in the multicenter, phase II, prospective I-SPY2 trial. We identify putative antibody-drug conjugate (ADC)-responsive patients, as evidenced by a 19-feature T-DM1 classifier, validated on I-SPY2. Deploying mFISHseq as a research-use only test on 48 patients demonstrates clinical feasibility, revealing insights into the efficacy of targeted therapies, like CDK4/6 inhibitors, immunotherapies, and ADCs.

abstract: Optical aberrations hinder fluorescence microscopy of thick samples, reducing image signal, contrast, and resolution. Here we introduce a deep learning-based strategy for aberration compensation, improving image quality without slowing image acquisition, applying additional dose, or introducing more optics. Our method (i) introduces synthetic aberrations to images acquired on the shallow side of image stacks, making them resemble those acquired deeper into the volume and (ii) trains neural networks to reverse the effect of these aberrations. We use simulations and experiments to show that applying the trained 'de-aberration' networks outperforms alternative methods, providing restoration on par with adaptive optics techniques; and subsequently apply the networks to diverse datasets captured with confocal, light-sheet, multi-photon, and super-resolution microscopy. In all cases, the improved quality of the restored data facilitates qualitative image inspection and improves downstream image quantitation, including orientational analysis of blood vessels in mouse tissue and improved membrane and nuclear segmentation in C. elegans embryos.

      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a prevalent and currently incurable autoimmune disease. Existing conventional medical treatments are limited in their efficacy, prolonged disease may lead to bone destruction, joint deformity, and loss of related functions, which places a huge burden on RA patients and their families. For millennia, the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), exemplified by the Gui-Zhi-Shao-Yao-Zhi-Mu decoction (GZSYZM), has been demonstrated to offer distinct therapeutic advantages in the management of RA. Exploring the potential mechanism of GZSYZM in the treatment of RA is a hot topic in the field of TCM.

abstract: Pluripotent stem cells possess a unique nuclear architecture characterized by a larger nucleus and more open chromatin, which underpins their ability to self-renew and differentiate. Here, we show that the nucleolus-specific RNA helicase DDX18 is essential for maintaining the pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells. Using techniques such as Hi-C, DNA/RNA-FISH, and biomolecular condensate analysis, we demonstrate that DDX18 regulates nucleolus phase separation and nuclear organization by interacting with NPM1 in the granular nucleolar component, driven by specific nucleolar RNAs. Loss of DDX18 disrupts nucleolar substructures, impairing centromere clustering and perinucleolar heterochromatin (PNH) formation. To probe this further, we develop NoCasDrop, a tool enabling precise nucleolar targeting and controlled liquid condensation, which restores centromere clustering and PNH integrity while modulating developmental gene expression. This study reveals how nucleolar phase separation dynamics govern chromatin organization and cell fate, offering fresh insights into the molecular regulation of stem cell pluripotency.

abstract: The current situation with H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) is causing a worldwide concern due to multiple outbreaks in wild birds, poultry, and mammals. Moreover, multiple zoonotic infections in humans have been reported. Importantly, HPAI H5N1 viruses with genetic markers of adaptation to mammals have been detected. Together with HPAI H5N1, avian influenza viruses H7N9 (high and low pathogenic) stand out due to their high mortality rates in humans. This raises the question of how prepared we are serologically and whether seasonal vaccines are capable of inducing protective immunity against these influenza subtypes. An observational study was conducted in which sera from people born between years 1925-1967, 1968-1977, and 1978-1997 were collected before or after 28 days or 6 months post-vaccination with an inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine. Then, hemagglutination inhibition, viral neutralization, and immunoassays were performed to assess the basal protective immunity of the population as well as the ability of seasonal influenza vaccines to induce protective responses. Our results indicate that subtype-specific serological protection against H5N1 and H7N9 in the representative Spanish population evaluated was limited or nonexistent. However, seasonal vaccination was able to increase the antibody titers to protective levels in a moderate percentage of people, probably due to cross-reactive responses. These findings demonstrate the importance of vaccination and suggest that seasonal influenza vaccines could be used as a first line of defense against an eventual pandemic caused by avian influenza viruses, to be followed immediately by the use of more specific pandemic vaccines.IMPORTANCEInfluenza A viruses (IAV) can infect and replicate in multiple mammalian and avian species. Avian influenza virus (AIV) is a highly contagious viral disease that occurs primarily in poultry and wild water birds. Due to the lack of population immunity in humans and ongoing evolution of AIV, there is a continuing risk that new IAV could emerge and rapidly spread worldwide, causing a pandemic, if the ability to transmit efficiently among humans was gained. The aim of this study is to analyze the basal protection and presence of antibodies against IAV H5N1 and H7N9 subtypes in the population from different ages. Moreover, we have evaluated the humoral response after immunization with a seasonal influenza vaccine. This study is strategically important to evaluate the level of population immunity that is a major factor when assessing the impact that an emerging IAV strain would have, and the role of seasonal vaccines to mitigate the effects of a pandemic.

abstract: Changes in brain mitochondrial metabolism are coincident with functional decline; however, direct links between the two have not been established. Here, we show that mitochondrial targeting via the adiponectin receptor activator AdipoRon (AR) clears neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and rescues neuronal tauopathy-associated defects. AR reduced levels of phospho-tau and lowered NFT burden by a mechanism involving the energy-sensing kinase AMPK and the growth-sensing kinase GSK3b. The transcriptional response to AR included broad metabolic and functional pathways. Induction of lysosomal pathways involved activation of LC3 and p62, and restoration of neuronal outgrowth required the stress-responsive kinase JNK. Negative consequences of NFTs on mitochondrial activity, ATP production, and lipid stores were corrected. Defects in electrophysiological measures (e.g., resting potential, resistance, spiking profiles) were also corrected. These findings reveal a network linking mitochondrial function, cellular maintenance processes, and electrical aspects of neuronal function that can be targeted via adiponectin receptor activation.

abstract: Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) generally has a favorable prognosis, and radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy is typically used for metastatic DTC that continues to progress and poses life-threatening risks. However, resistance to RAI in metastatic DTC significantly impairs treatment effectiveness. This study aims to identify potential compounds that may influence RAI efficacy. We conducted untargeted metabolomics on pre-treatment serum samples from 42 RAI-refractory DTC (RAIR-DTC) patients and 52 RAI-sensitive patients. The results revealed significantly elevated levels of two per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), PFDA and PFNA, in RAI-resistant patients. This accumulation was significantly negatively correlated with the expression of the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), which reflects the differentiation status and iodide uptake capability of thyroid cancer. Furthermore, high levels of PFDA and PFNA exposure were significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients undergoing RAI therapy. In vivo exposure simulations in a murine model showed that PFAS exposure significantly increased the malignant progression of thyroid cancer, reduced iodine uptake ability, and promoted dedifferentiation. Overall, these findings provide novel insights into the development of RAIR-DTC, highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring and control of PFAS exposure in cancer patients.

abstract: Central obesity is associated with higher risk of developing a wide range of diseases independent of overall obesity. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified more than 300 susceptibility loci associated with central obesity. However, the functional understanding of these loci is limited by the fact that most loci are in non-coding regions. To address this issue, our study first prioritized 2,034 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on fine-mapping and epigenomic annotation analysis. Subsequently, we employed self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) to systematically evaluate the enhancer activity of these prioritized SNPs. The resulting data analysis identified 141 SNPs with allelic enhancer activity. Further analysis of allelic transcription factor (TF) binding prioritized 20 key TFs mediating the central-obesity-relevant genetic regulatory network. Finally, as an example, we illustrate the molecular mechanisms of how rs8079062 acts as an allele-specific enhancer to regulate the expression of its targeted RNF157. We also evaluated the role of RNF157 in the adipogenic differentiation process. In conclusion, our results provide an important resource for understanding the genetic regulatory mechanisms underlying central obesity.

abstract: Although acute myeloid leukemia (AML) affects hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-supportive microenvironment, it is largely unknown whether leukemia-modified bone marrow (BM) microenvironment can be remodeled to support normal hematopoiesis after complete remission (CR). As a key element of BM microenvironment, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) provide a feasible way to investigate BM microenvironment remodeling. Here, we find reduced and dysfunctional BM EPCs in AML patients, characterized by impaired angiogenesis and high ROS levels, could be partially remodeled after CR and improved by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Importantly, HSC-supporting ability of BM EPCs is partially recovered, whereas leukemia-supporting ability is decreased in CR patients. Mechanistically, the transcriptome characteristics of leukemia-modified BM EPCs return to near-normal after CR. In a classic AML mouse and chemotherapy model, BM vasculature and normal hematopoiesis are reversed after CR. In summary, we provide further insights into how leukemia-modified BM microenvironment can be remodeled to support normal hematopoiesis after CR, which can be further improved by NAC.

abstract: Inflammation is a driving force of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) aging, causing irreversible exhaustion of functional HSCs. However, the underlying mechanism of HSCs erosion by inflammatory insult remains poorly understood. Here, we find that transient LPS exposure primes aged HSCs to undergo accelerated differentiation at the expense of self-renewal, leading to depletion of HSCs. Meanwhile, the central regulator nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) mediating functional impairment by inflammation insult induces differential transcriptional response in aged HSCs compared with young HSCs, with precocious activation of myeloid lineage genes. Altered compartmentalization and chromatin loop formation are associated with aging-related differential transcriptional response in HSCs upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Mechanistically, enhancer and promoter regions of myeloid lineage genes in aged HSCs are more accessible and display more rapid and prominent CTCF occupancy upon LPS stimulation. Our study provides comprehensive resources for the three-dimensional (3D) genome structure of HSCs and sheds light into the ordered genome organization and the associated transcriptome signature underlying HSCs aging.

abstract: Neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) lose regenerative potential with maturity, leading to minimal corticospinal tract (CST) axon regrowth after spinal cord injury (SCI). In young rodents, knockdown of PTEN, which antagonises PI3K signalling by hydrolysing PIP3, promotes axon regeneration following SCI. However, this effect diminishes in adults, potentially due to lower PI3K activation leading to reduced PIP3. This study explores if increased PIP3 generation can promote long-distance regeneration in adults. We used a hyperactive PI3K, PI3Kδ (PIK3CD), to boost PIP3 levels in mature cortical neurons and assessed CST regeneration after SCI. Adult rats received AAV1-PIK3CD and AAV1-eGFP, or AAV1-eGFP alone, in the sensorimotor cortex concurrent with a C4 dorsal SCI. Transduced neurons showed increased pS6 levels, indicating elevated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling. CST regeneration, confirmed with retrograde tracing, was evaluated up to 16 weeks post-injury. At 12 weeks, ∼100 axons were present at lesion sites, doubling to 200 by 16 weeks, with regeneration indices of 0.1 and 0.2, respectively. Behavioural tests showed significant improvements in paw reaching, grip strength, and ladder rung walking in PIK3CD-treated rats, corroborated by electrophysiological recordings of cord dorsum potentials and distal flexor muscles EMG. Thus, PI3Kδ upregulation in adult cortical neurons enhances axonal regeneration and functional recovery post-SCI.

abstract: Protein phosphorylation signaling networks have a central role in how cells sense and respond to their environment. We engineered artificial phosphorylation networks in which reversible enzymatic phosphorylation cycles were assembled from modular protein domain parts and wired together to create synthetic phosphorylation circuits in human cells. Our design scheme enabled model-guided tuning of circuit function and the ability to make diverse network connections; synthetic phosphorylation circuits can be coupled to upstream cell surface receptors to enable fast-timescale sensing of extracellular ligands, and downstream connections can regulate gene expression. We engineered cell-based cytokine controllers that dynamically sense and suppress activated T cells. Our work introduces a generalizable approach that allows the design of signaling circuits that enable user-defined sense-and-respond function for diverse biosensing and therapeutic applications.

abstract: Several transcription inhibitors have been developed as cancer therapies. However, they show modest clinical activity, highlighting that our understanding of the cellular response to transcriptional inhibition remains incomplete. Here we report that potent inhibitors of transcription not only impact mRNA output but also markedly impair mRNA transcript localization and nuclear export. We demonstrate that retention of newly transcribed mRNA in nuclear speckles is an adaptive response to chemically distinct transcriptional inhibitors. Retained transcripts are fully processed and accumulate in proportion to the expression level of the genes from which they emanate. The TREX mRNA export complex plays an integral role in directing nascent transcripts to nuclear speckles where they are bound to NXF1, protected from degradation, and poised for rapid export following re-initiation of transcription. Our findings provide new insights into the crosstalk between transcription and mRNA export with important implications for drugs aiming to inhibit transcription for therapeutic gain.

abstract: Angiogenesis describes the sprouting of blood vessels from existing vasculatures and it plays a pivotal role in disease progress such as diabetes, age-related macular degeneration and cancer. However, the most widely used anti-angiogenic agents targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway still lacked of specificity and therapeutic efficacy. To establish a method suitable for high-throughput drug screening and faithfully recapitulate the feature of in vivo angiogenesis, we generated a PECAM1-mRuby3-secNluc; ACTA2-EGFP dual reporter human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) line and utilizing the cell line to establish a visualized and quantifiable in vitro angiogenesis model with stem cell-derived vascular organoid. Using this method, we evaluated the anti-angiogenic effect of VEGFR inhibitor and efficiently identified several potential candidates of pro- and anti-angiogenic therapy via bioluminescence-based quantification. Overall, our study provides a valuable platform for in vitro drug screenings.

abstract: Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the most prescribed anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs. However, their use is often limited by substantial side effects, such as GC-induced osteoporosis (GIO) with the underlying mechanisms still not fully understood. In this study, we identify Tau as a low-affinity binding receptor for GCs that plays a crucial role in GIO. Tau deficiency largely abolished bone loss induced by high-dose dexamethasone, a synthetic GC, in both inflammatory arthritis and GIO models. Furthermore, TRx0237, a Tau inhibitor identified from an FDA-approved drug library, effectively prevented GIO. Notably, combinatorial administration of TRx0237 and dexamethasone completely overcame the osteoporosis adverse effect of dexamethasone in treating inflammatory arthritis. These findings present Tau as a previously unrecognized GC receptor with low affinity, and provide potential strategies to mitigate a spectrum of GC-related adverse effects, particularly osteoporosis.

abstract: Protective immunity to malaria depends on acquisition of parasite-specific antibodies, with Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) being one of the most important target antigens. The effector functions of PfEMP1-specific IgG include inhibition of infected erythrocyte (IE) sequestration and opsonization of IEs for cell-mediated destruction. IgG glycosylation modulates antibody functionality, with increased affinity to FcγRIIIa for IgG lacking fucose in the Fc region (Fc-afucosylation). We report here that selective Fc-afucosylation of PfEMP1-specific IgG1 increases with age in P. falciparum-exposed children and is associated with reduced risk of anemia, independent of the IgG levels. A similar association was found for children having PfEMP1-specific IgG1 inducing multiple effector functions against IEs, particularly those associated with antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by NK cells. Our findings provide new insights regarding protective immunity to P. falciparum malaria and highlight the importance of cell-mediated destruction of IgG-opsonized IEs.

abstract: Following DNA replication, the newly reassembled chromatin is disorganized and must mature to its steady state to maintain both genome and epigenome integrity. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing this critical process remain poorly understood. Here, we show that histone H3K56 acetylation (H3K56ac), a mark on newly-synthesized H3, facilitates the remodeling of disorganized nucleosomes in nascent chromatin, and its removal at the subsequent G2/M phase of the cell cycle marks the completion of chromatin maturation. In vitro, H3K56ac enhances the activity of ISWI chromatin remodelers, including yeast ISW1 and its human equivalent SNF2h. In vivo, a deficiency of H3K56ac in nascent chromatin results in the formation of closely packed di-nucleosomes and/or tetra-nucleosomes. In contrast, abnormally high H3K56ac levels disrupt chromatin maturation, leading to genome instability. These findings establish a central role of H3K56ac in chromatin maturation and reveal a mechanism regulating this critical aspect of chromosome replication.

abstract: Insomnia is a common and challenging complaint in older adults (> 65 years) because of age-related alterations in sleep physiology. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is the gold standard for treatment of insomnia in young as well as older patients. Both clinicians and patients often prefer the simplicity of medication, but risks associated with some hypnotics increase with age. Pharmacologic options for older adults include low-dose doxepin, melatonin, ramelteon, and the dual orexin receptor antagonists. A well-informed clinician can help patients navigate the risks and benefits of both pharmacologic and behavioral options.

abstract: The relationship between bicarbonate level and mortality in critically sick patients with infective endocarditis (IE) is currently not well established. The MIMIC-IV database was used to provide data for a retrospective cohort research. Included were patients with IE who were hospitalized to the critical care unit (ICU). Within the first 24 h following ICU admission, the serum bicarbonate was assessed. The 28-day mortality was the end-point result. To evaluate the relationship between the serum bicarbonate and 28-day mortality, multivariable Cox regression was employed. The study included 450 patients with IE in serious condition in the ICU, with a 57.4-year-old average and 64.2% male representation. The 28-day mortality rate stood at 20%. Unadjusted analysis revealed that higher serum bicarbonate levels upon ICU admission were significantly linked to reduced 28-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.95; p < 0.001). This correlation remained significant after adjusting for potential confounding factors (adjusted HR, 0.94; 95% CI 0.89-0.99; p = 0.028). When categorizing bicarbonate levels, patients in the highest group (T3, ≥ 25 mEq/L) showed a significantly decreased adjusted HR of 0.55 (95% CI 0.33-0.93; p < 0.001) in relation to the control group (T1, ≤ 22 mEq/L) in the final model. Consistent results were observed in subgroup analyses across various groups. In patients with IE in the ICU, elevated serum bicarbonate upon admission was independently linked to a lower 28-day mortality. These findings indicate that serum bicarbonate can serve as a prognostic marker, supporting the process of risk assessment and providing direction for the clinical care of patients with IE.

abstract: With advancing age, significant changes occur in the female reproductive system, the most notable of which is the decline in oocyte quality, a key factor affecting female fertility. However, the mechanisms underlying oocyte aging remain poorly understood. In this study, we obtained oocytes from aged and young female mice and performed single-cell transcriptome sequencing, comparing our findings with existing proteomic analyses. Our analysis revealed that one of the primary characteristics of aging oocytes is the disruption of calcium ion homeostasis. Specifically, we identified two key genes involved in the oocyte aging process, Calb1 and Rpl23. Experimental validation demonstrated that knockdown of CALB1 in oocytes led to reduced calcium ion levels in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and meiotic defects. Further experiments suggested that RPL23 may function as a downstream gene of CALB1, and its knockdown caused mitochondrial dysfunction, excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and spindle assembly defects. Notably, overexpression of these two genes in aging oocytes partially rescued the maternal age-related defective phenotypes, underscoring their crucial roles in oocyte aging. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the specific mechanisms underlying mouse oocyte aging at single-cell resolution, supported by experimental validation, and offers new directions and potential targets for future research into age-related reproductive health issues.

abstract: Neuroepithelial cell transforming gene 1 (NET1) is a member of the Ras homologue family member A (RhoA) subfamily of guanine nucleotide exchange factors and a key protein involved in the activation of Rho guanosine triphosphatases, which act as regulators of cell proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, and cell movement and are crucial for cancer spread. Research has shown that NET1 can regulate the malignant biological functions of tumour cells, such as growth, invasion, and metastasis, and it is closely related to the progression of pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, and liver cancer. However, the comprehensive role and mechanistic function of NET1 in other types of cancer remain largely unexplored. A deeper understanding of the role of NET1 may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of cancer progression and metastasis. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of NET1 in cancer biology. The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression databases were utilized to analyse the differential expression of NET1 in normal and cancer tissues. The prognostic value of NET1 in cancer was evaluated through log-rank tests and Cox regression models. Further analysis was conducted to assess the relationships between NET1 expression and clinical features, as well as its diagnostic value. We investigated potential factors contributing to genetic alterations in NET1 to elucidate the role of NET1 in cancer progression. We also explored the relationships between NET1 and genes associated with epigenetic modifications, oncogenes, and tumour characteristics, such as RNA stemness scores (RNAss), DNA stemness scores (DNAss), the tumour mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI). Additionally, we analysed the associations between NET1 expression and immune cell infiltration, immunoregulatory genes, and sensitivity to therapeutic drugs. We conducted gene set enrichment analysis to further investigate the signalling pathways that might be affected by changes in NET1. The prognostic value of NET1 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) was further validated using real-world and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data. Finally, through both in vivo and in vitro experiments, we confirmed that the overexpression of NET1 contributed to the malignant progression of TNBC cells, and we explored the potential mechanism by which NET1 regulates malignant biological behaviour through cellular experiments. Our study revealed a higher expression level of NET1 in 18 types of tumour tissues than in their corresponding normal tissues. Specifically, we observed high expression of NET1 in LIHC, LUSC, PAAD, and BRCA tumour tissues, which was associated with a poor prognosis. In terms of gene alterations, "amplification", "mutation", and "deep deletion" were identified as the main types of changes occurring in NET1. Among these, "amplification" was predominantly observed in LIHC, LUSC, PAAD, and BRCA. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was found between copy number variations and the NET1 expression level in various tumours, including LIHC, LUSC, PAAD, and BRCA. We also discovered that NET1 expression was positively correlated with the expression of genes related to epigenetic modification in almost all types of cancer and was related to the expression levels of numerous oncogenes. In certain tumours, a significant positive correlation was noted between the expression of NET1 and TMB, MSI, DNAss, and RNAss. Intriguingly, in most tumours, NET1 expression was strongly negatively correlated with the levels of infiltrating natural killer cells and M1 macrophages. Moreover, NET1 expression was significantly positively correlated with the expression of immune genes in nearly all types of cancer. An analysis of single-cell data revealed that NET1 was expressed primarily in malignant tumour cells in most tumours, with little to no expression in immune cells. Additionally, the expression level of NET1 was associated with sensitivity to various therapeutic drugs. Data from GEO and real-world studies indicated high expression of NET1 in TNBC tissues, which was correlated with a poor prognosis. Cellular experiments indicated that NET1 could regulate the proliferation, invasion, cell cycle, and apoptosis of TNBC cells. Furthermore, NET1 may mediate the malignant proliferation of tumour cells through the AKT signalling pathway. NET1 can serve as a potential prognostic marker for LIHC, LUSC, PAAD, and BRCA tumours. Real-world data further suggest that NET1 can also serve as a prognostic indicator for TNBC. High expression of NET1 may contribute to the malignant proliferation of TNBC cells, potentially through the AKT signalling pathway. Moreover, NET1 may contribute to the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment that can promote tumour progression. Therefore, targeting NET1 may represents a promising approach for inhibiting tumour progression.

abstract: Ideal root system architecture (RSA) is important for efficient nutrient uptake and high yield in crops. We cloned and characterized a key RSA regulatory gene, GRAVITROPISM LOSS 1 (OsGLS1), in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The gls1 mutant displays an increased root growth angle, longer primary roots, more adventitious roots and greater nutrient uptake efficiency and grain yield in paddy fields. OsGLS1 is strongly expressed in the root tips of seedlings and in leaves at the flowering stage. OsGLS1 encodes a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase mainly localizing at the basal plasma membrane (PM) in several root cell types when phosphorylated on its Ser-30 residue. OsGLS1 interacts with, ubiquitinates and promotes the degradation of basally localized PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2) via the 26S proteasome, thus establishing the typical apical PM localization of OsPIN2 and polar auxin transport, ultimately shaping RSA. This previously unidentified OsGLS1-OsPIN2 regulatory pathway will contribute to an optimal RSA for enhancing nutrient efficiency in rice and other crops.

abstract: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) is a key gluconeogenic enzyme that plays complex and context-dependent roles in cancer biology. This review comprehensively examines FBP1's dual functions as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene across various cancer types. In many cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and lung cancer, downregulation of FBP1 contributes to tumor progression through metabolic reprogramming, promoting glycolysis, and altering the tumor microenvironment. Conversely, in certain contexts like breast and prostate cancers, FBP1 overexpression is associated with tumor promotion, indicating its oncogenic potential. The review explores FBP1's interactions with immune cells within the tumor microenvironment, influencing immune surveillance and tumor immune escape mechanisms. Additionally, FBP1 emerges as a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, with expression levels correlating with patient outcomes in multiple cancers. Future therapeutic strategies targeting FBP1 are discussed, including inhibitors, activators, epigenetic modulation, and combination therapies, while addressing the challenges posed by its dual nature. Understanding the multifaceted roles of FBP1 offers valuable insights into cancer metabolism and opens avenues for personalized therapeutic interventions.

abstract: Berberine (BBR) has been proved to inhibit the malignant progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the underlying molecular mechanism still needs to be further revealed. NSCLC cells (A549 and H1299) were treated with BBR. CCK8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, TUNEL staining and transwell assay were used to examine cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion. The levels of spindle pole body component 25 (SPC25) and NDC80 kinetochore complex component (NUF2) were detected by qRT-PCR or western blot. The interaction between SPC25 and NUF2 was confirmed by Co-IP assay and FISH assay. Xenograft tumors were constructed to assess the anti-tumor role of BBR in vivo. BBR inhibited NSCLC cell growth, invasion and glycolysis. SPC25 was upregulated in NSCLC tissues, and BBR could reduce SPC25 expression in NSCLC cells. SPC25 knockdown repressed NSCLC cell growth, invasion and glycolysis, and its overexpression also reversed the anti-tumor effect of BBR. SPC25 could interact with NUF2, and NUF2 overexpression abolished the inhibitory effect of SPC25 knockdown or BBR on NSCLC cell behaviors. In animal experiments, BBR could suppress NSCLC tumor growth by inhibiting SPC25/NUF2 axis in vivo. BBR mainly played an anti-NSCLC role by targeting SPC25/NUF2 axis, which provided a new idea for NSCLC treatment.

abstract: High-volume disease (HVD) and low-volume disease (LVD) definitions in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) patients are based on conventional imaging (CI) (CT/MRI with bone scan [BS]) according to CHAARTED criteria. HVD and LVD definitions are associated with overall survival and are used for treatment decisions. It remains unknown how these definitions transfer to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET imaging. The aim of this retrospective multicenter study was to compare the CI-based disease volume criteria to PSMA PET-based volume definitions in a CHAARTED-like cohort. Methods: mHSPC patients from 5 international sites who underwent PSMA PET/CT or PSMA PET/MRI and BS within a time interval of 100 d and without initiation of a new therapy between the 2 scans were retrospectively included in the analysis. CHAARTED HVD and LVD criteria were applied to BS, CT, MRI, and PSMA PET. HVD was defined by the presence of visceral metastases or at least 4 bone metastases (with ≥1 beyond the spine or pelvis). Whole-body (WB) tumor burden was estimated with the automated bone scan index (aBSI, EXINI v2.0) on BS and with the WB PSMA PET-positive tumor volume (PSMA-TV) on PSMA PET, respectively. Results: Sixty-seven patients with paired PSMA PET and BS were included. The median prostate-specific antigen level was 54.9 ng/mL (interquartile range [IQR], 10.4-191.0 ng/mL). On the basis of CI, it was determined that 17 of 67 patients had HVD-CI (25.4%) and 50 of 67 patients had LVD-CI (74.6%). On the basis of PSMA PET, it was determined that 27 of 67 patients had HVD-PET (40.3%) and 24 of 67 patients had LVD-PET (35.8%). In total, 16 of 67 patients (22.4%) had no visible lesion or only locoregional pelvic disease (M0) with PSMA PET (M0-PET). Stage migration between CI and PSMA PET occurred in 27 of 67 patients (40.3%) by both upstaging and downstaging: 11 of 50 (22%) LVD-CI patients were HVD-PET, whereas 1 of 17 (5.9%) HVD-CI and 15 of 50 (30%) of LVD-CI patients were M0-PET. The median WB PSMA-TV and automated BS index were 248.0 mL (IQR, 54.6-1,427.0 mL) and 3.4% (IQR, 1,0-7.2%) for HVD-CI, 25.1 mL (IQR, 6.6-74.6 mL) and 0.1% (IQR, 0.0-0.2%) for LVD-CI, 141.0 mL (IQR, 47.5-458.0 mL) and 0.9% (IQR, 0.04-4.1%) for HVD-PET, and 31.5 mL (IQR, 10.1-67.9 mL) and 0% (IQR, 0-0.1%) for LVD-PET, respectively. The optimal WB PSMA-TV to stratify CI-based CHAARTED LVD-CI versus HVD-CI was 107 mL with a misclassification of 21.9%. Conclusion: Compared with CI, addition of PSMA PET leads to M0 downstaging in every third and LVD to HVD upstaging in every fifth mHSPC patient. Future HVD and LVD definitions based on PSMA PET/CT should be adjusted based on patient outcome.

abstract: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the small bowel mucosa that develops because of the altered immune response to gluten, which leads to intestinal epithelium damage and villous atrophy. However, studies on regeneration of the damaged small bowel mucosa and density of intestinal stem cells (ISC) in CD persons are still scarce. We aimed to evaluate the number of small bowel mucosa cells positive for LGR5, CD138/Syndecan-1, CD71 and CXCR3 in CD and in controls with normal bowel mucosa; to find relationship between these markers and degree of small intestinal atrophy and to compare these results with our previous data about the number of CD103 + , IDO + DCs, FOXP3 + Tregs, enterovirus (EV) density and serum zonulin level. The paraffin sections of the small bowel biopsies were obtained from 26 children with CD (median age 6.5 years), and from 20 controls with normal intestinal mucosa (median age 14.2 years) and from the tissue bank of the Department of Pathology of Tartu University Hospital (from 18 participants with CD including 14 children (median age 13.2 years) and from 11subjects with normal small bowel mucosa, including one child aged 4.8 years. The number of LGR5 + , CD71 + , CD138 + , and CXCR3 + cells was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. The median number of CD138 + and CXCR3 + cells was significantly higher in the small bowel mucosa in CD compared with normal mucosa (p = 0.0002 for CD138 and p = 0.006 for CXCR3). The median number of CD71 + cells was significantly higher in normal small bowel mucosa (p = 0.005). The number of LGR5 + cells did not differ between persons with CD and those with normal small bowel mucosa (p = 0.7). A markedly increased number of CD138 + and CXCR3 + cells in the small bowel mucosa of participants with CD confirms their role in the pathogenesis of this disease. There was no expected marked difference in the density of any of the studied markers between lower or higher grade of small bowel atrophy and level of tTG-IgA in CD.

abstract: There is insufficient evidence comparing the outcomes of tacrolimus-based remission induction therapy with infliximab in refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) and evidence regarding optimal strategies after tacrolimus-based remission induction therapy. We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective study of patients with UC treated with tacrolimus or infliximab between January 2010 and March 2019. The proportion of clinical remission at week 8 and cumulative colectomy-free rate were examined using propensity score matching analysis. The predictors for colectomy after tacrolimus induction were also investigated. Ninety patients in the tacrolimus group and 151 in the infliximab group were enrolled. The proportion of patients in clinical remission at week 8 was 65.2% in the matched tacrolimus group and 37.3% in the matched infliximab group (P = 0.0016), and the long-term colectomy-free rate was lower in the matched tacrolimus group than in the matched infliximab group (P = 0.0003). After clinical remission with tacrolimus, a serum albumin level of ≤ 3.5 g/dL at week 8 was extracted as a factor predicting colectomy (area under the curve: 0.94). Tacrolimus showed a higher remission induction effect for UC compared to infliximab. However, a high rate of colectomy after transition to maintenance treatment was found to be a concern for tacrolimus therapy.

abstract: Human brain organoids (hBOs) are in vitro, 3D, self-organizing brain tissue structures increasingly used for modeling brain development and disease. Although they traditionally lack vasculature, recent bioengineering developments enable their vascularization, which partly recapitulates neurodevelopmental processes such as neural tube angiogenesis, formation of neurovascular unit (NVU)-like structures, and early barriergenesis. Although vascularized hBOs (vhBOs) are already used to model (defects in) neurovascular development, vascularization efficiency and other outcomes differ substantially between vascularization protocols and overall shortcomings should be considered. For instance, vessel-like structures in vhBOs do not contain blood-like flow nor do they form a functional blood-brain barrier (BBB). Extended characterization, standardization, and the development of new bioengineering techniques may enable broader applications of vhBOs such as drug transport studies.

abstract: Glioma is characterized by high heterogeneity and poor prognosis. Attempts have been made to understand its diversity in both genetic expressions and radiomic characteristics, while few integrated the two omics in predicting survival of glioma. This study was intended to investigate the connection between glioma imaging and genome, and examine its predictive value in glioma mortality risk and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Clinical, transcriptomics and radiomics data were obtained from public datasets and patients in our center. Correlation analysis between gene expression and radiomic feature (RF) was performed, followed by survival analysis to select RF-related genes (RFRGs) and gene expression-related RFs (GRRFs). After that, RFRGs and GRRFs were used to construct mortality risk prediction model of all glioma and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild type (WT) glioma. The association between RFRGs and TIME was explored. Six cohorts composed of 1,754 glioma patients were included. Thirty-five genes and eighty-two RFs demonstrated high correlation with each other. Gene score based on RFRGs was independent predictor of both glioma (P < 0.05) and IDH-WT glioma (P < 0.05). Same score based on GRRFs was also able to stratify risk of both glioma (P < 0.0001) and IDH-WT glioma (P < 0.0001), with nomograms constructed separately. The TIME of gliomas predicted with RFRGs' score found mismatched risk of death with immune response. RFRGs and GRRFs were able to predict glioma mortality risk and TIME. Further studies could validate our results and explore this genome-imaging interactions.

abstract: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven effective in mRNA delivery, as evidenced by COVID-19 vaccines. Its key ingredient, ionizable lipids, is traditionally optimized by inefficient and costly experimental screening. This study leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual screening to facilitate the rational design of ionizable lipids by predicting two key properties of LNPs, apparent pKa and mRNA delivery efficiency. Nearly 20 million ionizable lipids were evaluated through two iterations of AI-driven generation and screening, yielding three and six new molecules, respectively. In mouse test validation, one lipid from the initial iteration, featuring a benzene ring, demonstrated performance comparable to the control DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3). Notably, all six lipids from the second iteration equaled or outperformed MC3, with one exhibiting efficacy akin to a superior control lipid SM-102. Furthermore, the AI model is interpretable in structure-activity relationships.

abstract: The immune escape capacities of XBB variants necessitate the authorization of vaccines with these antigens. In this study, we produce three recombinant trimeric proteins from the RBD sequences of Delta, BA.5, and XBB.1.5, formulating a trivalent vaccine (Tri-Vac) with an MF59-like adjuvant at a 1:1:4 ratio. Tri-Vac demonstrates immunogenicity in female NIH mice, inducing cross-neutralization against various SARS-CoV-2 variants, including pre-Omicron and Omicron BA.2.75, BA.5, and XBB lineages. It elicits measurable antigen-specific T cell responses, germinal center B cell responses, and T follicular helper responses, effectively protecting against live Omicron XBB.1.16 challenges. Protective immunity is maintained long-term, with sustained neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses, as well as memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells observed by day 210 post-immunization. Tri-Vac also serves as a candidate booster for enhancing immunity after three doses of inactivated virus or mRNA vaccines. A phase 1 investigator-initiated trial was initiated to assess safety and immunogenicity in humans, focusing on the primary endpoint of adverse reactions within 7 days and key secondary endpoints including the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of serum neutralizing antibodies within 30 days and 6 months post-vaccination, as well as adverse events within 30 days and serious adverse events within 6 months post-vaccination. Preliminary data indicate Tri-Vac has good safety and immunogenicity, improving neutralization against multiple variants, including JN.1, in previously vaccinated individuals, highlighting its clinical potential for protecting against SARS-CoV-2 variants. The registration number of this clinical trial is ChiCTR2200067245.

abstract: The most severe form of α-thalassemia results from loss of all four copies of α-globin. Postnatally, patients face challenges similar to β-thalassemia, including severe anemia and erythrotoxicity due to the imbalance of β-globin and α-globin chains. Despite progress in genome editing treatments for β-thalassemia, there is no analogous curative option for α-thalassemia. To address this, we designed a Cas9/AAV6-mediated genome editing strategy that integrates a functional α-globin gene into the β-globin locus in α-thalassemia patient-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Incorporation of a truncated erythropoietin receptor transgene into the α-globin integration cassette significantly increased erythropoietic output from edited HSPCs and led to the most robust production of α-globin, and consequently hemoglobin tetramers. By directing edited HSPCs toward increased production of clinically relevant erythroid cells, this approach has the potential to mitigate the limitations of current treatments for the hemoglobinopathies, including low genome editing and low engraftment rates.

abstract: Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of pneumonia, often caused by so-called typical and atypical pathogens including Streptoccocus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, respectively. Here, we employed a variety of mouse models to investigate how diabetes influences pulmonary antibacterial immunity. Following intranasal infection with S. pneumoniae or L. pneumophila, type 2 diabetic and prediabetic mice exhibited higher bacterial loads in their lungs compared to control animals. Single cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and functional analyses revealed a compromised IFNγ production by natural killer cells in diabetic and prediabetic mice, which was associated with reduced IL-12 production by CD103+ dendritic cells. Blocking IFNγ enhanced susceptibility of non-diabetic mice to L. pneumophila, while IFNγ treatment restored defense against this intracellular pathogen in diabetic animals. In contrast, IFNγ treatment did not increase resistance of diabetic mice to S. pneumoniae, suggesting that impaired IFNγ production is not the sole mechanism underlying the heightened susceptibility of these animals to pneumococcal infection. Thus, our findings uncover a mechanism that could help to explain how type 2 diabetes predisposes to pneumonia. We establish proof of concept for host-directed treatment strategies to reinforce compromised IFNγ-mediated antibacterial defense against atypical lung pathogens.

abstract: The recent discovery of nonvisual photoreceptors in various organs has raised expectations for uncovering their roles and underlying mechanisms. In this work, we identified a previously unrecognized hormone-releasing mechanism in the pituitary of the Japanese rice fish (medaka) induced by light. Ca2+ imaging analysis revealed that melanotrophs, a type of pituitary endocrine cell that secretes melanocyte-stimulating hormone, robustly increase the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ during short-wavelength light exposure. Moreover, we identified Opn5m as the key molecule that drives this response. Knocking out opn5m attenuated melanogenesis by reducing tyrosinase expression in the skin. Our findings suggest a mechanism in which direct reception of short-wavelength light by pituitary melanotrophs triggers a pathway that might contribute to protection from ultraviolet radiation in medaka.

abstract: The currently approved drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are only for symptomatic treatment in the early stages of the disease but they could not halt the neurodegeneration, additionally, the safety profile of the recently developed immunotherapy is a big issue. This review aims to explain the importance of the drugs repurposing technique and strategy to develop therapy for AD. We illustrated the biological alterations in the pathophysiology of AD including the amyloid pathology, the Tau pathology, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, insulin signaling impairment, wingless-related integration site/β-catenin signaling, and autophagy. Additionally, we demonstrated the different repurposed drugs in the experimental models of AD including the anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetic, antiepileptic, antidepressant and anticancer drugs. Further, we showed the pipeline and FDA approved drugs for AD. The repurposed drugs have a promising therapeutic activity against AD, confirming the value of the drugs repurposing technique to elucidate curative therapy for AD.

Neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, B cells and T cells execute innate and adaptive immune processes in the coronary atherosclerotic plaque and in the ischaemic myocardium. Prolonged inflammation contributes to ischaemic heart failure. The spleen is also a target of neuromodulation through vagal, sympathetic and sensory nerve activation. Efferent vagal activation and subsequent activation of the noradrenergic splenic nerve activate β2-adrenergic receptors on splenic T cells, which release acetylcholine that ultimately results in attenuation of cytokine secretion from splenic macrophages. Coeliac vagal nerve activation increases splenic sympathetic nerve activity and drives the release of T cells, a process that depends on placental growth factor. Activation of the vagosplenic axis protects acutely from ischaemia-reperfusion injury during auricular tragus vagal stimulation and remote ischaemic conditioning. Splenectomy abrogates all these deleterious and beneficial actions on the cardiovascular system. The aggregate effect of splenectomy in humans is a long-term increase in mortality from ischaemic heart disease. The spleen has been appreciated as an important immune organ for inflammatory processes in atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction and heart failure, whereas its complex interaction with circulating blood factors and with the autonomic and somatic nervous systems, as well as its role in cardioprotection, have emerged only in the past decade. In this Review, we describe this newly identified cardioprotective function of the spleen and highlight the potential for translating the findings to patients with ischaemic heart disease.

abstract: Background:
        
      
      Ovarian cancer (OvC) constitutes significant management challenges primarily due to its late-stage diagnosis and the development of resistance to chemotherapy. The standard treatment regimen typically includes carboplatin and paclitaxel, with the addition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) harboring BRCA1/2 mutations. However, the variability in treatment responses suggests the need to investigate factors beyond BRCA1/2 mutations, such as DNA repair mechanisms and epigenetic alterations. Notably, homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) is observed in an additional 20% of HGSOC cases, indicating a broader spectrum of DNA repair defects. Existing commercial HRD assays have certain limitations, prompting a global effort to develop new genomic and functional tests through academic research.

abstract: Pro-inflammatory macrophage activation is a hallmark example of how mitochondria serve as signaling organelles. Oxidative phosphorylation sharply decreases upon classical macrophage activation, as mitochondria are thought to shift from ATP production towards accumulating signals that amplify effector function. However, evidence is conflicting regarding whether this collapse in respiration is essential or dispensable. Here we systematically examine this question and show that reduced oxidative phosphorylation is not required for pro-inflammatory macrophage activation. Different pro-inflammatory stimuli elicit varying effects on bioenergetic parameters, and pharmacologic and genetic models of electron transport chain inhibition show no causative link between respiration and macrophage activation. Furthermore, the signaling metabolites succinate and itaconate can accumulate independently of characteristic breaks in the TCA cycle in mouse and human macrophages, and peritoneal macrophages can be activated in vivo without inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. The results indicate there is plasticity in the metabolic phenotypes that can support pro-inflammatory macrophage activation.

abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) necessitates innovative prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. By investigating PNMA1 in HCC via the TCGA and GEO databases and our clinical data, we found that its overexpression is associated with worse survival. The relevance of PNMA1 extends to immune factors such as M1 macrophages, CD8+ T cells, and immune checkpoints. Mechanistically, PNMA1 shapes a suppressive tumor microenvironment strongly linked to bile acid metabolism. It promotes tumor progression via immune inhibition and PI3K-AKT pathway activation. Notably, PNMA1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as confirmed by reduced IC50 values and molecular docking. Experimental knockdown of PNMA1 hindered HepG2 cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, PNMA1 is a pivotal HCC biomarker and therapeutic target with a focus on cancer progression, immune modulation, and bile acid metabolism.

abstract: Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease resulting from a mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene and characterized by progressive motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and psychiatric disturbances. Currently, no disease-modifying treatments are available. Recent research has developed therapeutic agents that may have the potential to directly target the disease pathology, such as gene silencing or clearing the mutant protein. However, these agents are limited by their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), preventing optimal therapeutic effects. Although various techniques have been explored to overcome the BBB, focused ultrasound (FUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive therapeutic modality offering the potential for targeted intervention in neurodegenerative diseases, including HD. Preclinical studies demonstrated the safety and efficacy of FUS in delivering therapeutic agents, such as siRNAs and AAV vector-based gene therapy, resulting in significant reductions in mutant HTT expression and improvements in motor function in HD mouse models. Furthermore, the safety profile of FUS-induced BBB opening has been established in clinical trials on human patients of neurodegenerative diseases other than HD, showing no adverse effects on brain structure or function. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of FUS research in HD and connects existing evidence from neurodegenerative disease studies with its promise in establishing disease-modifying therapies for HD.

abstract: Addictions seem to be more frequent in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis patients than in the general population. This cross-sectional observational study comparatively evaluated substance-related and behavioural addictions in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis patients and analysed possible addiction patterns. From October 2023 to April 2024, 100 atopic dermatitis and 104 psoriasis patients at a German university hospital completed an anonymous questionnaire, including sociodemographic and health-related parameters, along with validated assessment tools for common addictions (smoking, gambling, alcohol, drugs, food, and internet). More psoriasis patients had at least 1 addiction (50.0% vs 39.0%), were more frequent daily smokers (34.6% vs 15.0%) and reported gambling more frequently than atopic dermatitis patients. No differences emerged regarding gambling addiction. Psoriasis patients showed higher body mass index, with 1.9% addicted to food. Atopic dermatitis patients were more vulnerable to pathological internet use (9.0% vs 2.9%). Low happiness was a risk factor for smoking in atopic dermatitis and for gambling and drug consumption in psoriasis patients. Low disease severity was associated with pathological alcohol in-take in psoriasis. Younger age emerged as a ubiquitous risk factor for drug consumption. Distinct addiction patterns in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis patients, influenced by age, happiness, and disease severity, should guide the development of education and screening strategies.

abstract: Human cancer cell lines are the mainstay of cancer research. Recent reports showed that highly mutated adult carcinoma cell lines (mainly HeLa and MCF-7) present striking diversity across laboratories and that long-term continuous culturing results in genomic/transcriptomic heterogeneity with strong phenotypical implications. Here, we hypothesize that oligomutated pediatric sarcoma cell lines mainly driven by a fusion transcription factor, such as Ewing sarcoma (EwS), are genetically and phenotypically more stable than the previously investigated adult carcinoma cell lines. A comprehensive molecular and phenotypic characterization of multiple EwS cell line strains, together with a simultaneous analysis during 12 months of continuous cell culture show that fusion-driven pediatric sarcoma cell line strains are genomically more stable than adult carcinoma strains, display remarkably stable and homogenous transcriptomes, and exhibit uniform and stable drug response. Additionally, the analysis of multiple EwS cell lines subjected to long-term continuous culture reveals that variable degrees of genomic/transcriptomic/phenotypic changes among fusion-driven cell lines, further exemplifying that the potential for reproducibility of in vitro scientific results may be rather understood as a spectrum, even within the same tumor entity.

abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases are often characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. In Alzheimer's disease, abnormal tau phosphorylation disrupts mitophagy, a quality control process through which damaged organelles are selectively removed from the mitochondrial network. The precise mechanism through which this occurs remains unclear. Previously, we showed that tau which has been mutated at Thr-231 to glutamic acid to mimic an Alzheimer's-relevant phospho-epitope expressed early in disease selectively inhibits oxidative stress-induced mitophagy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we use immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cell lines to extend that result into mammalian cells. Specifically, we show that phosphomimetic tau at Ser-396/404 (EC) or Thr-231/Ser-235 (EM) partly inhibits mitophagy induction by paraquat, a potent inducer of mitochondrial oxidative stress. Moreover, a combination of immunologic and biochemical approaches demonstrates that the levels of the mitophagy receptor FKBP8, significantly decrease in response to paraquat in cells expressing EC or EM tau mutants, but not in cells expressing wildtype tau. In contrast, paraquat treatment results in a decrease in the levels of the mitophagy receptors FUNDC1 and BNIP3 in the presence of both wildtype tau and the tau mutants. Interestingly, FKBP8 is normally trafficked to the endoplasmic reticulum during oxidative stress induced mitophagy, and our results support a model where this trafficking is impacted by disease-relevant tau, perhaps through a direct interaction. We provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease and highlight FKBP8 receptor as a potential target for mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.

abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a central nervous system degenerative disease with a stealthy onset and a progressive course characterized by memory loss, cognitive dysfunction, and abnormal psychological and behavioral symptoms. However, the pathogenesis of AD remains elusive. An increasing number of studies have shown that oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and oligodendroglial lineage cells (OLGs), especially OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes (OLGs), which are derived from OPCs, play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD. OLGs function mainly by myelinating axons, transmitting electrical signals, and regulating neural development. In addition to myelin, OPCs and OLGs can also participate in AD pathogenesis in other ways. This review summarizes the mechanisms by which OPCs and OLGs affect myelin formation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, the blood-brain barrier, synaptic function, and amyloid-beta protein and further elucidates the mechanisms by which oligodendrocyte lineage cells participate in AD pathogenesis and treatment, which is highly important for clarifying the pathogenesis of AD, clinical treatment, and prevention.

abstract: Leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by Leishmania parasites, continues to pose global health challenges. Current treatments face issues like resistance, safety, efficacy, and cost. This review covers the discovery, mechanisms of action, clinical applications, and limitations of key antileishmanial agents: pentavalent antimonials, amphotericin B, miltefosine, paromomycin, and pentamidine. Despite toxicity and resistance (antimonials), hospitalization needs and side effects (amphotericin B), regional efficacy variability (miltefosine), inconsistent outcomes (paromomycin), and severe side effects (pentamidine), these drugs are vital. Novel strategies to overcome the deficiencies of current therapies are highlighted, including combination regimens, advanced drug delivery systems, and immunomodulatory approaches. Comprehensive and cooperative efforts are crucial to fully realize the potential of advancements in antileishmanial pharmacotherapy and to reduce the unacceptable worldwide burden imposed by this neglected disease.

abstract: Clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 is causing an unprecedented outbreak in dairy cows in the United States. To understand if recent H5N1 viruses are changing their receptor use, we screened recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) from historical and recent 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses for binding to distinct glycans bearing terminal sialic acids using a glycan microarray. We find that H5 from A/Texas/37/2024, an isolate from the dairy cow outbreak, has increased binding breadth to core glycans bearing terminal α2,3 sialic acids, the avian receptor, compared to historical and recent 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses. We do not observe any binding to α2,6 sialic acids, the receptor used by human seasonal influenza viruses. Using molecular dynamics and a cryo-EM structure of A/Texas/37/2024 H5, we show A/Texas/37/2024 H5 is more flexible within the receptor-binding site compared to a 2.3.4.4b H5 from 2022. We identify a single mutation outside of the receptor binding site, T199I, is responsible for increased binding breadth, as it increases receptor binding site flexibility. Together, these data show recent H5N1 viruses are evolving increased receptor binding breadth which could impact the host range and cell types infected with H5N1.

abstract: Antibodies targeting immune checkpoints, such as PD-1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4, have transformed the treatment of patients with lung cancers. Unprecedented rates of durable responses are achieved in an imperfectly characterized population of patients with metastatic disease. More recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors have been explored in patients with resectable non-small-cell lung cancers. Following a traditional paradigm, antibody therapies were first studied in the adjuvant setting, after surgery and chemotherapy. Pivotal trials supported global approvals of the PD-L1/-1 antibodies atezolizumab and pembrolizumab in this setting. Exciting observations were made when checkpoint inhibitors were moved to the preoperative window: Several signal-finding studies explored a limited number of cycles prior to surgery, and reproducibly reported complete or major histopathological responses. So far, six published phase III trials have demonstrated the superiority of combining the PD-1/-L1 antibodies nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, tislelizumab or toripalimab with 3 to 4 courses of preoperative platinum-based chemotherapy over preoperative chemotherapy alone in terms of response rates and survival endpoints. Those patients achieving complete or major histopathological responses experienced particularly favorable long-term outcomes. It is yet unclear, whether there is true synergism between immunotherapy and chemotherapy, and whether outcomes are further improved by adding postoperative checkpoint inhibition. While these pivotal trials qualify neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy as another option in curative lung cancer treatment, there is hope that the chemotherapy backbone will be ultimately replaced by rationally selected and targeted combination partners. Here, the current status and future avenues of neoadjuvant combination immunotherapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer are reviewed.

abstract: The molecular mechanisms underlying cell migration remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that knock-out cells for NHSL3, the most recently identified member of the Nance-Horan Syndrome family, are more persistent than parental cells in single cell migration, but that, in wound healing, follower cells are impaired in their ability to follow leader cells. The NHSL3 locus encodes several isoforms. We identify the partner repertoire of each isoform using proteomics and predict direct partners and their binding sites using an AlphaFold2-based pipeline. Rescue with specific isoforms, and lack of rescue when relevant binding sites are mutated, establish that the interaction of a long isoform with MENA/VASP proteins is critical at cell-cell junctions for collective migration, while the interaction of a short one with 14-3-3θ in lamellipodia is critical for single cell migration. Taken together, these results demonstrate that NHSL3 regulates single and collective cell migration through distinct mechanisms.

abstract: In women globally, breast cancer ranks as the second most frequent cause of cancer-related deaths, making up about 25% of female cancer cases, which is pretty standard in affluent countries. Breast cancer is divided into subtypes based on aggressive, genetic and stage. The precise cause of the problem is still unknown. However, the following significant risk factors have been found: sex, age, heredity, not having children, breastfeeding, elevated hormone levels, and personal lifestyle. The presence or lack of three nuclear receptors ER, PR, and HER2/ERBB2 (triple negative) and the amplification of the HER2/ErbB2 gene are the clinical criteria used to classify breast cancer. Chemotherapy is still the cornerstone of treatment for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), even. If, for the first two groups of patients,receptor-specific therapy is used. The most often prescribed chemotherapy agents for the treatment of breast cancer include doxorubicin (DOX), curcumin paclitaxel (PTX), docetaxel (DCX), thioridazine (THZ), disulfiram (DSF), and camptothecin (CPT). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were used in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) to bind tumor-associated target antigens selectively and deliver very effective cytotoxic agents. According to recent research, synthetic derivatives effectively combat both MCF- 7 and breast cancer cell lines that are resistant to many drugs. This review provides a wealth of information on the mechanism of action of synthetic derivatives on multidrug-resistant cell lines. This review includes information about how synthetic derivatives affect cancer cells that have developed multidrug resistance during chemotherapy. These mechanisms have been linked to factors such as increased drug efflux, genetic factors, growth factors, increased DNA repair capacity, and elevated xenobiotic metabolism. Because of this, more research is necessary to learn more about the effectiveness of synthetic derivatives against breast cancer and cell lines that are resistant to several drugs. This review aims to find recent prospects of various types of cellular signaling pathways (JAK/STAT, Akt, MAPK, etc.) involved in the progression of breast cancer disorder, and we also study different synthetic and natural drugs that are applied for treating breast cancer.

abstract: In women globally, breast cancer ranks as the second most frequent cause of cancer-related deaths, making up about 25% of female cancer cases, which is pretty standard in affluent countries. Breast cancer is divided into subtypes based on aggressive, genetic and stage. The precise cause of the problem is still unknown. However, the following significant risk factors have been found: sex, age, heredity, not having children, breastfeeding, elevated hormone levels, and personal lifestyle. The presence or lack of three nuclear receptors ER, PR, and HER2/ERBB2 (triple negative) and the amplification of the HER2/ErbB2 gene are the clinical criteria used to classify breast cancer. Chemotherapy is still the cornerstone of treatment for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), even. If, for the first two groups of patients,receptor-specific therapy is used. The most often prescribed chemotherapy agents for the treatment of breast cancer include doxorubicin (DOX), curcumin paclitaxel (PTX), docetaxel (DCX), thioridazine (THZ), disulfiram (DSF), and camptothecin (CPT). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were used in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) to bind tumor-associated target antigens selectively and deliver very effective cytotoxic agents. According to recent research, synthetic derivatives effectively combat both MCF- 7 and breast cancer cell lines that are resistant to many drugs. This review provides a wealth of information on the mechanism of action of synthetic derivatives on multidrug-resistant cell lines. This review includes information about how synthetic derivatives affect cancer cells that have developed multidrug resistance during chemotherapy. These mechanisms have been linked to factors such as increased drug efflux, genetic factors, growth factors, increased DNA repair capacity, and elevated xenobiotic metabolism. Because of this, more research is necessary to learn more about the effectiveness of synthetic derivatives against breast cancer and cell lines that are resistant to several drugs. This review aims to find recent prospects of various types of cellular signaling pathways (JAK/STAT, Akt, MAPK, etc.) involved in the progression of breast cancer disorder, and we also study different synthetic and natural drugs that are applied for treating breast cancer.

abstract: Anti-angiogenesis offers an important treatment strategy for metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Metronomic chemotherapy (MCT) provides antiangiogenic effects without increased toxicities, making it good partner for antiangiogenic therapy. We conducted the present retrospective study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib plus MCT for HER2 negative MBC. Patients with HER2 negative MBC who received metronomic chemotherapy (Vinorelbine (NVB), Capecitabine (CAPE), Etoposide (VP-16)) with anlotinib were retrospectively analyzed from Jan 2019 to Dec 2021. The primary end point was progression free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS) and safety. 48 patients with HER2 negative MBC were enrolled. 19 (39.6%) patients received NVB, 17 (35.4%) patients received CAPE and 12 (25.0%) patients received VP-16. The overall ORR and DCR were 8.3% (4/48) and 87.5% (42/48) respectively. The median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI 4.3-7.0 months), and the median OS was 25.2 months (95% CI 20.2-30.1 months). The patients with age ≥ 50 (5.3 vs. 7.7 months, P = 0.014, HR = 0.407) and pathologic grade 1 or 2 (6.2 vs. 3.2 months, P = 0.023, HR = 2.471) had significantly longer PFS. The patients with hormone receptor (HR) positive (5.3 vs. 7.7 months, P = 0.004, HR = 0.206) and pathologic grade 1 or 2 (6.2 vs. 3.2 months, P = 0.020, HR = 3.882) had significantly longer OS. The incidence of all grades adverse events (AEs) was 56.3% (27/48) and grade 3-4 AEs was 12.5% (6/48). Within the context of real-world clinical practice, anlotinib in combination with metronomic chemotherapy provides a well-tolerated and effective treatment option for HER2-negative MBC, which warrants further investigation in the future.

abstract: Human ANP32A/B (huANP32A/B) poorly support the polymerase activity of avian influenza viruses (AIVs), thereby limiting interspecies transmission of AIVs from birds to humans. The SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) within NS2 promotes the adaptation of AIV polymerase to huANP32A/B via a yet undisclosed mechanism. Here we show that huANP32A/B are SUMOylated by the E3 SUMO ligase PIAS2α, and deSUMOylated by SENP1. SUMO modification of huANP32A/B results in the recruitment of NS2, thereby facilitating huANP32A/B-supported AIV polymerase activity. Such a SUMO-dependent recruitment of NS2 is mediated by its association with huANP32A/B via the SIM-SUMO interaction module, where K68/K153-SUMO in huANP32A or K68/K116-SUMO in huANP32B interacts with the NS2-SIM. The SIM-SUMO-mediated interactions between NS2 and huANP32A/B function to promote AIV polymerase activity by positively regulating AIV vRNP-huANP32A/B interactions and AIV vRNP assembly. Our study offers insights into the mechanism of NS2-SIM in facilitating AIVs adaptation to mammals.

abstract: Somatic cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by overexpressing defined transcription factors. Specifically, overexpression of OCT4 alone has been demonstrated to reprogram mouse fibroblasts into iPSCs. However, it remains unclear whether any other single factor can induce iPSCs formation. Here, we report that SALL4 alone, under an optimized reprogramming medium iCD4, is capable of reprogramming mouse fibroblasts into iPSCs. Mechanistically, SALL4 facilitates reprogramming by inhibiting somatic genes and activating pluripotent genes, such as Esrrb and Tfap2c. Furthermore, we demonstrate that co-overexpressing SALL4 and OCT4 synergistically enhances reprogramming efficiency. Specifically, the activation of Rsk1/Esrrb/Tfap2c by SALL4, alongside OCT4's activation of Sox2 and the suppression of Mndal by SALL4 and Sbsn by OCT4, cooperate to facilitate SALL4+OCT4-mediated reprogramming. Overall, our study not only establishes an efficient method for iPSCs induction using the SALL4 single factor but also provides insights into the synergistic effects of SALL4 and OCT4 in reprogramming.

abstract: Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) control tissue homeostasis and orchestrate mucosal inflammation; however, the precise mechanisms governing ILC3 activity are fully understood. Here, we identified the transmembrane protein neuropilin-1 (NRP1) as a positive regulator of interleukin (IL)-17-producing ILC3s in the intestine. NRP1 was markedly upregulated in intestinal mucosal biopsies from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with healthy controls. Genetic deficiency of NRP1 reduces the frequency of ILC3s in the gut and impairs their production of IL-17A in an NF-κB signaling-dependent and cell-intrinsic manner. The diminished IL-17A production in ILC3s altered the composition of the microbiota and improved the outcome of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of NRP1 with EG00229 alleviated the severity of colitis. These observations demonstrated the critical role of NRP1 in the control of intestinal ILC3s, suggesting that NRP1 is a potential therapeutic target for IBD.

abstract: The prominence of circular RNAs (circRNAs) has surged in cancer research due to their distinctive properties and impact on cancer development. This review delves into the role of circRNAs in four key cancer types: colorectal cancer (CRC), gastric cancer (GC), liver cancer (HCC), and lung cancer (LUAD). The focus lies on their potential as cancer biomarkers and drug targets. Our study analyses the reported circRNAs in the mentioned malignancies, examining their nature, functions, targets, origins, and contributions as tumor enhancers or suppressors. The approach involved assessing full-text reports on PMC, utilizing keywords such as "CircRNA" and "Cancer types," coupled with bioinformatics, experimental assays, or clinical investigations. Exclusions encompassed non-English publications, conference abstracts, letters, and expert opinions. The findings unveil 577 identified circRNAs across these cancer types: 124 in CRC, 177 in GC, 93 in HCC, and 183 in LUAD. Mechanistic insights into how circRNAs modulate gene expression in cancer are explored, particularly their interactions with microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Dysregulation of circRNAs across various cancers and their potential as diagnostic and prognostic indicators are synthesized. The exploration extends to the potential of targeting circRNAs as a novel cancer therapy strategy, either through inhibiting oncogenic circRNAs or reinstating tumor-suppressive ones. This article discusses the challenges and prospects in harnessing circRNAs for cancer diagnostics and therapies. These comprehensive analyses hold promise for advancing cancer research and fostering the development of innovative therapies and diagnostics.

abstract: The concept of immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by chemotherapy as a potential synergistic modality for cancer immunotherapy has been widely discussed. Unfortunately, most chemotherapeutic agents failed to dictate effective ICD responses due to their defects in inducing potent ICD signaling. Here, we report a dual-enzyme-instructed peptide self-assembly platform of CPMC (CPT-GFFpY-PLGVRK-Caps) that cooperatively utilizes camptothecin (CPT) and capsaicin (Caps) to promote ICD and engage systemic adaptive immunity for tumor rejection. Although CPT and Caps respectively prevent tumor progression by inhibiting type-I DNA topoisomerase and activating transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) for intracellular calcium overload, neither alone effectively stimulates sufficient ICD signaling to meet immunotherapeutic needs. CPMC, sequentially allowing an active Caps derivative of VRK-Caps and CPT to release extracellularly and intracellularly, can synergize two distinct apoptosis pathways stimulated by Caps and CPT to increase tumor immunogenicity and elicit systemic T-cell-based immunity. Consequently, CPMC facilitates the generation of improved tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses and sustained immunological memory, successfully suppressing both primary and distant tumors. Moreover, CPMC can render tumors susceptible to PD-L1 blockade and synergize with an antiprogrammed cell death-ligand 1 (aPDL1) antibody for tumor inhibition. Combining two cancer chemotherapeutic drugs with low ICD-stimulating capacity using a peptide self-assembly strategy was demonstrated to boost ICD responses and potentiate cancer immunotherapy.

abstract: Inflammasomes are crucial mediators of both antimicrobial host defense and inflammatory pathology, requiring stringent regulation at multiple levels. This review explores the pivotal role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in modulating inflammasome activation through various regulatory mechanisms. We detail recent advances in understanding MAPK-mediated regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome priming, licensing and activation, with emphasis on MAPK-induced activator protein-1 (AP-1) signaling in NLRP3 priming, ERK1 and JNK in NLRP3 licensing, and TAK1 in connecting death receptor signaling to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, we discuss novel insights into MAPK signaling in human NLRP1 inflammasome activation, focusing on the MAP3K member ZAKα as a key kinase linking ribosomal stress to inflammasome activation. Lastly, we review recent work elucidating how Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin (LeTx) manipulates host MAPK signaling to induce macrophage apoptosis as an immune evasion strategy, and the counteraction of this effect through genotype-specific Nlrp1b inflammasome activation in certain rodent strains.

abstract: Background: Whether autoimmune diseases caused any effects on the risk of cancers remained yet clarified. This study aimed to investigate the causal effect of autoimmune diseases on pan-cancers through mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Method: The GWAS summary datasets of 10 autoimmune diseases were derived from the IEU or UK biobank website. The GWAS summary datasets of 39 cancers were derived from the FinnGen website. The Inverse-Variance Weighted (IVW) method was used to analyze the causal association between auto-immune diseases and pan-cancers. Results: MR analysis indicated that inflammatory bowel disease would significantly increase the risk of rectum cancer, basal cell carcinoma and skin cancer, while Crohn's disease only showed causal association with increased risk of skin cancer. Rheumatoid arthritis significantly increased the risk of thyroid gland cancer, while reduce the risk of overall cancers and 7 other types of cancer outcomes. Ankylosing spondylitis showed causal relationship with increased risk of overall cancers and 5 other types of cancer outcomes. Multiple sclerosis significantly increased the risk of overall cancers and 5 other types of cancer outcomes, while reduce the risk of pancreas cancer (P=0.04). Parkinson's disease significantly reduced the risk of rectum cancer and skin cancer. Systemic lupus erythematosus significantly increased the risk of 3 types of cancer, while reduced the risk of kidney and urinary tract cancer. Psoriasis significantly increased the risk of head neck and oral cavity cancer, while reduced the risk of 3 other types of cancer. Conclusion: This study provides novel genetic epidemiological evidence linking several autoimmune diseases to various cancer, both retrospective studies and basic research on this topic should carefully consider the genetic susceptibility to autoimmune diseases in relation to cancer, including potential risk and protective factors. These findings may inform preventive strategies and treatment approaches.

abstract: The assembly of repressive heterochromatin in eukaryotic genomes is crucial for silencing lineage-inappropriate genes and repetitive DNA elements. Paradoxically, transcription of repetitive elements within constitutive heterochromatin domains is required for RNA-based mechanisms, such as the RNAi pathway, to target heterochromatin assembly proteins. However, the mechanism by which heterochromatic repeats are transcribed has been unclear. Using fission yeast, we show that the conserved trimeric transcription factor (TF) PhpCNF-Y complex can infiltrate constitutive heterochromatin via its histone-fold domains to transcribe repeat elements. PhpCNF-Y collaborates with a Zn-finger containing TF to bind repeat promoter regions with CCAAT boxes. Mutating either the TFs or the CCAAT binding site disrupts the transcription of heterochromatic repeats. Although repeat elements are transcribed from both strands, PhpCNF-Y-dependent transcripts originate from only one strand. These TF-driven transcripts contain multiple cryptic introns which are required for the generation of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) via a mechanism involving the spliceosome and RNAi machinery. Our analyses show that siRNA production by this TF-mediated transcription pathway is critical for heterochromatin nucleation at target repeat loci. This study reveals a mechanism by which heterochromatic repeats are transcribed, initiating their own silencing by triggering a primary cascade that produces siRNAs necessary for heterochromatin nucleation.

abstract: Ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a critical area of research for cancer therapy. This review delves into the intricate relationship between lipid metabolism and ferroptosis, emphasizing the impact of lipidome remodeling on cancer cell susceptibility. We explore key mechanisms, such as the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids and phosphatidylethanolamines in ferroptosis induction, alongside the protective effects of monounsaturated fatty acids and their regulatory enzymes. We also discuss the influence of dietary fatty acids, lipid droplets, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition on ferroptosis and cancer resistance. By integrating current findings on enzymatic regulation, lipid peroxidation pathways, and metabolic adaptations, this review highlights potential therapeutic strategies targeting lipid metabolism to enhance ferroptosis-based cancer treatments. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive overview that underscores the significance of lipid metabolic pathways in ferroptosis and their implications for developing novel cancer therapies.

abstract: Osteosarcoma is an aggressive malignant bone tumor with an obscure etiology, as well as high prevalence and poor prognosis in children and adolescents. We aimed to investigate the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma through a comprehensive analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) using multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. SLC25A5, a gene implicated in cellular aging, significantly influenced osteosarcoma development by altering the TIME and promoting CD8+ T cell exhaustion, which contributed to reduced chemosensitivity. Experimental validation demonstrated that SLC25A5 enhanced the proliferative, migratory, invasive, and osteolytic properties of drug-resistant osteosarcoma cells while reducing apoptosis, intensifying cisplatin resistance. Phyllanthin inhibited the malignant phenotype of cisplatin-resistant osteosarcoma cells and enhanced their sensitivity to cisplatin by suppressing SLC25A5 expression. This study highlights a novel pathogenic role of SLC25A5 in osteosarcoma and presents Phyllanthin as a promising therapeutic agent. Our study offers a pioneering exploration of the single-cell spatiotemporal evolution of osteosarcoma and identifies SLC25A5 as a critical factor in drug resistance and immune evasion. By integrating advanced single-cell technologies and functional assays, we provided novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying osteosarcoma progression and treatment resistance, facilitating innovative therapeutic strategies.

abstract: The impact of blood glucose-lowering medications on weight has always been a topic of interest in the treatment of diabetic patients. This study investigates the effect of empagliflozin on weight in patients with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. This quasi-experimental study was performed on patients with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes with an HbA1c level up to 1% higher than the treatment target, and not using other blood glucose-lowering medications. Patients received 10 milligrams of Empagliflozin once daily for three months, and weight, BMI, waist circumference, and blood pressure were evaluated monthly. Forty-three patients (21 women and 22 men) enrolled. The average weight of patients decreased by 2.96 ± 1.96 kg (3.8%) (P < 0.001). BMI decreased by -1.10 ± 0.71 Kg/m2 (3.72%) (P < 0.001). The waist circumference of patients decreased by -3.23 ± 3.69 centimeters (P < 0.001). FPG decreased from 114.86 to 109.48 mg/dL (P < 0.001), and HbA1c decreased from 6.52% to 6.38% (P < 0.001). The weight change was more significant in men than women (-3.59 ± 1.74 vs. -2.30. ± 1.99), (P = 0.029). Weight reduction was greater in patients with GFR higher than 90 compared to GFR lower than 90 (-3.34. ± 2.00 vs. -2.16 ± 1.67) (P = 0.063). Also, no significant difference was observed in the weight, BMI, and waist circumference changes between different BMI groups (less than 25, 25 to 30, 30 to 35, and higher than 35). The trend of weight and BMI changes during the three-month empagliflozin treatment period was significant (P < 0.001) and didn't reach a plateau level after three months. The change in waist circumference was also significant, reaching a plateau level after one month (P < 0.001). There was no significant change in blood pressure. In conclusion the weight, BMI, and waist circumference of patients decreased following the administration of empagliflozin. Weight reduction was more pronounced in males than females and in patients with a GFR above 90 than those with a GFR below 90.

While various gut-derived postbiotics or bacterial metabolites have been created as dietary supplements to prevent or reverse bone loss, their efficacy and safety still need improvement. Herein, a colon-targeted drug delivery system is developed using surface engineering of polyvinyl butyrate nanoparticles by shellac resin to achieve sustained release of postbiotics butyric acid at the colorectal site. These engineered postbiotics nanoparticles can effectively suppress macrophage inflammatory activation, modulate the redox balance, and regulate the composition of the gut microbiota, thereby restoring epithelial barriers, inhibiting bacterial invasion, and down-regulating pro-inflammatory responses. As a result, the remission of systemic inflammation is accompanied by a rebalancing of osteoblast and osteoclast activity, alleviating inflammatory bowel disease-related and post-menopausal bone loss. Specifically, the treatment of engineered postbiotics nanoparticles can also improve the quality and quantity of bone with restoration of deteriorative mechanical properties, which indicating a therapeutic potential on fracture prevention. This study provides valuable insights into the gut-bone axis and establishes a promising and safe therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis.

abstract: Drug resistance is an important factor for prostate cancer (PCa) to progress into refractory PCa, and abnormal lipid metabolism usually occurs in refractory PCa, which presents great challenges for PCa therapy. Here, a cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) inhibitor sulfosuccinimidyl oleate sodium (CD36i) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) siRNA (siSCD1) are selected to inhibit lipid uptake and synthesis in PCa, respectively. To this end, a multiresponsive drug delivery nanosystem, HA@CD36i-TR@siSCD1 is designed. The hyaluronic acid (HA) gel "shell" of HA-TR nanosystem can release drugs in response to the acidic tumor microenvironment and hyaluronidase, and the tumor targeting (TR) cationic micellar "core" can release drugs in response to glutathione. This multiresponsive drug release is beneficial for the exogenous inhibition of lipid uptake by CD36i and the endogenous inhibition of lipid synthesis by siSCD1. The established HA-TR nanosystem has good tumor targeting ability and tumor penetration ability, and that HA@CD36i-TR@siSCD1 has good synergistic effects, which can significantly restrain the growth, invasion, and metastasis of PCa. Moreover, under high-fat conditions, the tumors are more sensitive to HA@CD36i-TR@siSCD1 treatment, almost no accumulation of lipid droplets is observed in HA@CD36i-TR@siSCD1-treated tumors, with enhanced antitumor immunity. Hence, this study provides a new treatment option for refractory PCa patients, especially those with a high-fat diet.

abstract: During the past decade, there has been extraordinary public, media, and medical research interest in psychedelics as promising therapeutics for difficult-to-treat psychiatric disorders. Short-term controlled trial data suggest that certain psychedelics are effective and safe in the treatment of major depressive disorder, treatment-resistant depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Preliminary evidence also supports efficacy in other psychiatric disorders (e.g., tobacco and alcohol use disorders). Notwithstanding the interest and promise of psychedelics, concerns have arisen with respect to the interpretability and translatability of study results. For example, aspects related to short- and long-term safety, abuse liability, and the essentiality of the psychedelic "trip" and psychological support are, inter alia, insufficiently characterized with psychedelic agents. The overarching aims in this overview are 1) to review methodological aspects that affect inferences and interpretation of extant psychedelic studies in psychiatric disorders, and 2) to provide guidance for future research and development of psychedelic treatment in psychiatry, critical to study interpretation and clinical implementation.

abstract: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a kind of molecular chaperone that helps protein folding, which is closely related to cancer. However, the association between HSPs and clear cell renal clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is uncertain. We explored the prognostic value of HSP110, HSP90, HSP70 and HSP60 families in ccRCC and their role in tumor immune microenvironment. The data obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were applied to determine the differential expression of HSPs in normal tissues and ccRCC. We comprehensively analyzed the prognostic value of HSPs in ccRCC and constructed a prognostic signature. We further explored the differences of tumor immune microenvironment and targeted therapy based on the signature. Cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis were detected by CCK8 assay, wound healing and transwell. Three clusters were identified with differences in overall survival and tumor stage. 6-gene signature (HSPA8, HSP90B1, HSPA7, HSPA12B, HSPA4L, HSPA1L) was identified to predict ccRCC patients' prognosis. The signature was confirmed in the internal cohort. Survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis demonstrated the accuracy and independence of signature. The expression of HSPA7, HSPA8 and HSP90B1 were validated with quantitative real-time PCR. Our signature played a pivotal role in predicting tumor immune microenvironment, immune checkpoint gene expression, drug sensitivity, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) in patients with ccRCC. Our cellular experiments confirmed HSPA7 promotes the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of ccCRC cells. The HSPs signature identified in this study could serve as potential biomarkers for predicting prognosis and treatment response in ccRCC patients. It may provide new ideas for the current research on targeted therapy and immunotherapy strategies for ccRCC patients.

abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous malignancy. The process of ferroptosis regulates tumor growth and represents a promising therapeutic target for GCs. Despite Salidroside (Sal) being able to regulate ferroptosis in a variety of diseases, there are still limited reports on its therapeutic effects and potential targets in treating GC. This study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of Sal-induced ferroptosis in GC. Our analysis, integrating databases like PharmMapper, Swiss Target Prediction, TargetNet, GeneCards, TTD, OMIM, STRING, and DAVID. Human gastric cancer MGC803 cells and tumor-bearing mice were used to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of Sal on GC in vitro and in vivo. CCK-8, LDH, and Calcein-AM/ PI were used to assess cell viability and damage. FerroOrange, Lillie's Ferrous Iron Stain, MDA, ROS, BODIPY™ 581/591 C11, GSH, and GPxs were used to detect intracellular Fe2+ concentration, lipid peroxidation level, and antioxidant defense system. qRT-PCR and western blot were performed to explore relevant mechanism studies. Network pharmacology results showed that Sal shares 322 targets with GC, which have biological functions related to lipid metabolism, cell death, and lipid peroxidation. Experiments further confirmed that Sal inhibits MGC803 cells by inducing ferroptosis, as evidenced by the induction of elevated Fe2+ and increased lipid peroxidation. Fer-1, an inhibitor of ferroptosis, reversed the anti-GC effect of Sal in MGC803 cells and GC tumor-bearing mice. Further confirmation of the association between Sal and ferroptosis in GC. Subsequently, bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms identified nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) as a candidate signature gene associated with ferroptosis in GC, and molecular docking shows that NCOA4 binds Sal. We then performed in vivo and in vitro experiments to elucidate that Sal targeting NCOA4, a cargo receptor mediating ferritinophagy, mediates autophagic degradation of ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1, Fe2+ storage protein), which further increases Fe2+ and lipid peroxidation. In addition, Sal induces mitochondrial dysfunction and increases mitochondrial ROS levels, which activates autophagy and triggers autophagic degradation of FTH1. Taken together, we revealed that NCOA4 is a new target for Sal-anchored GC and that Sal may be a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of GC.

abstract: This retrospective observational multicentre cohort study compared the rate of postoperative cystoid macular oedema (CME) between two intraocular lens (IOL) scleral fixation (SFIOL) techniques: a flanged IOL fixation technique (Yamane technique) and a suture IOL transscleral fixation technique (conventional technique). The study included 207 eyes with postoperative CME that had undergone SFIOL and were observed for > 12 weeks between January 2019 and January 2021. The primary endpoint was a comparison of the rate of postoperative CME at 3 months between groups. Secondary endpoints were a comparison of postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 3 months between groups and an analysis of characteristics associated with postoperative CME in the Yamane technique group. The Yamane technique group developed postoperative CME in 13.0% of eyes at 3 months, compared with 1.9% in the conventional technique group (odds ratio: 7.99, P = 0.045). Postoperative BCVA was consistently significantly higher in the Yamane technique group. Although many retinal surgeons have performed the Yamane technique because of its convenience for SFIOL, our findings suggest that the Yamane technique carries an increased risk of postoperative CME compared with the conventional suture method. Therefore, careful management of postoperative CME is needed after SFIOL.

abstract: In this study, we identified cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) molecular subtypes and developed a CAF-based prognostic model for breast cancer (BRCA). The heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their significant involvement in the advancement of BRCA were discovered employing single-cell RNA sequencing. Notably, we discovered that the RUNX1/SDC1 axis enhances BRCA cell invasion and metastasis. RUNX1 transcriptionally upregulates SDC1, which facilitates extracellular matrix remodeling and promotes tumor cell migration. This finding highlights the vital contribution of CAFs to the tumor microenvironment and provides new potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The predictive model showcased remarkable precision in anticipating patient outcomes and could guide personalized treatment strategies.

abstract: Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) is a presynaptic protein targeted by the antiseizure drug levetiracetam. One or more of the three SV2 genes is expressed in all neurons and is essential to normal neurotransmission. Loss of SV2A results in a seizure phenotype in mice and mutations in humans are also linked to congential seizures. How affecting SV2A action impacts the epileptic phenotype remains unclear, especially among the diverse neuronal populations that regulate network excitability. This study explored how brain structure and function are affected by SV2A conditional knock-out (SV2A-cKO) in specific neural cell subtypes. We show that SV2A-cKO in all neurons of the postnatal brain triggers lethal seizures, suggesting that the seizures observed in earlier knockout models were not due to aberrant brain development. Similar lethal seizures are detected in mice in which the loss of SV2A is limited to GABAergic neurons, whereas loss in excitatory neurons produces no noticeable phenotype. No apparent gender difference was ever observed. Further investigation revealed that SV2A-cKO in different GABAergic interneuron populations induces seizure, with variable timescales and severity. Most notably SV2A-cKO in parvalbumin interneurons (PV+) leads to lethal seizures in young animals, while SV2A-cKO in somatostatin (SST) inhibitory neurons results in seizures that were scarcely observed only in adult mice. These results support the crucial role SV2A plays in PV and SST interneurons and suggest that the action of Levetiracetam may be due largely to effects on a subset of GABAergic interneurons.Significance statement The synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A is the target of the antiseizure drug levetiracetam, and the SV2A full knockout in mice induce severe seizures. Still, SV2A function in synapses is yet not fully elucidated, including the neuronal subtypes in which SV2A expression is mandatory or dispensable. In this paper, we demonstrated that SV2A knockout in inhibitory neurons provokes seizure (incl. PV+ and SST+) whereas it does not induce any visible phenotype in excitatory neurons. Our study supports the key role of SV2A in interneuron populations, in the context of epilepsy.

abstract: Deafness is the most common form of sensory impairment in humans and frequently caused by defects in hair cells of the inner ear. Here we demonstrate that in male mice which model recessive non-syndromic deafness (DFNB6), inactivation of Tmie in hair cells disrupts gene expression in the neurons that innervate them. This includes genes regulating axonal pathfinding and synaptogenesis, two processes that are disrupted in the inner ear of the mutant mice. Similar defects are observed in mouse models for deafness caused by mutations in other genes with primary functions in hair cells. Gene therapy targeting hair cells restores hearing and inner ear circuitry in DFNB6 model mice. We conclude that hair cell function is crucial for the establishment of peripheral auditory circuitry. Treatment modalities for deafness thus need to consider restoration of the function of both hair cells and neurons, even when the primary defect occurs in hair cells.

abstract: Studies indicate that breast tissue has a distinct modifiable microbiome population. We demonstrate that endocrine-targeting therapies, such as tamoxifen, reshape the non-cancerous breast microbiome to influence tissue metabolism and reduce tumorigenesis. Using 16S sequencing, we found that tamoxifen alters β-diversity and increases Firmicutes abundance, including Lactobacillus spp., in mammary glands (MGs) of mice and non-human primates. Immunohistochemistry showed that lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-positive bacteria were elevated in tamoxifen-treated breast tissue. In B6.MMTV-PyMT mice, intra-nipple probiotic bacteria injections reduced tumorigenesis, altered metabolic gene expression, and decreased tumor proliferation. Probiotic-conditioned media selectively reduced viability in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells and altered mitochondrial metabolism in non-cancerous epithelial cells. Human tumor samples revealed that LTA-positive bacteria negatively correlated with Ki67, suggesting that endocrine therapies influence tumor-associated microbiota to regulate proliferation. Our data indicate that endocrine-targeting therapies modify the breast microbiome, corresponding with a shift in tissue metabolism to potentially reduce ER+ breast cancer risk.

abstract: In the past decades, Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has achieved remarkable success, leading to the approval of six therapeutic products for haematological malignancies. Recently, the therapeutic potential of this therapy has also been demonstrated in non-tumoral diseases. Currently, the manufacturing process to produce clinical-grade CAR-T cells is complex, time-consuming, and highly expensive. It involves multiple steps, including the collection of T cells from patients or healthy donors, in vitro engineering and expansion, and finally reinfusion into patients. Therefore, despite the impressive clinical outcomes, ex vivo manufacturing process makes CAR-T cells out of reach for many cancer patients. Direct in vivo engineering of T cells could be a more rapid solution able to circumvent both the complexity and the costs associated with ex vivo manufactured CAR-T cells. This novel approach allows to completely eliminate ex vivo cell manipulation and expansion while producing therapeutic cell populations directly in vivo. To date, several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of in vivo T cell reprogramming, by employing injectable viral- or nanocarrier-based delivery platforms in tumour animal models. Additionally, in vivo production of CAR-T cells might reduce the incidence, or at least the severity, of systemic toxicities frequently occurring with ex vivo produced CAR-T cells, such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. In this review, we highlight the challenges associated with the current ex vivo manufacturing protocols and review the latest progresses in the emerging field of in vivo CAR-T therapy, by comparing the various platforms so far investigated. Moreover, we offer an overview of the advantages deriving from in vivo reprogramming of other immune cell types, such as Natural Killer and macrophages, with CAR constructs.

abstract: The lack of knowledge about the mechanism of hyperoxia-induced intestinal injury has attracted considerable attention, due to the potential for this condition to cause neonatal complications. This study aimed to explore the relationship between hyperoxia-induced oxidative damage and ferroptosis in intestinal tissue and investigate the mechanism by which hyperoxia regulates inflammation through ferroptosis. The study systematically evaluated the effects of hyperoxia on oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, ferroptosis, and inflammation of intestinal epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that ferroptosis was involved in intestinal oxidative damage caused by hyperoxia and was regulated by Nrf2. Moreover, hyperoxia-induced oxidative damage regulated inflammation through ferroptosis by upregulating the COX-2/PGE2/EP2 signaling pathway. These findings have important implications for future clinical prevention and therapeutic approaches to neonatal organ injury caused by hyperoxia treatment.

abstract: The Cardiometabolic Index (CMI) is a well-recognized risk factor for a range of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. However, the population-level characteristics of CMI and its potential association with mortality risk among individuals over 40 years of age have not been investigated. This study aims to assess the association between CMI and both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among the middle-aged and elderly population. This cohort study utilized data from 3752 American adults extracted from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) conducted from 1995 to 2011. The CMI was calculated using the waist-to-height ratio, triglycerides (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, with mortality data sourced from the SHHS Linked Mortality File. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression models were employed to assess the prognostic value of the CMI. Among the 3752 American adults, the mean (SD) age was 65.9 (10.1) years, and 1969 (52.5%) were women. The mean (SD) CMI was 0.914 ± 0.939. Over an average follow-up period of 10.7 years, there were 926 all-cause deaths and 289 cardiovascular deaths. Participants were categorized into three groups based on their CMI levels: tertile (T) 1: 0.315 ± 0.0994; T2: 0.680 ± 0.128; T3: 1.75 ± 1.23. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that elevated CMI was significantly associated with all-cause mortality (HR 1.215, 95% CI 1.032-1.43 for T2; HR 1.309, 95% CI 1.115-1.537 for T3) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.305, 95% CI 0.971-1.755 for T2; HR 1.457, 95% CI 1.091-1.947 for T3). After adjusting for confounders, elevated CMI remained significantly associated with all-cause mortality (HR 1.315, 95% CI 1.098-1.575 for T3) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.562, 95% CI 1.124-2.17 for T3). Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated significantly worse outcomes for participants in the higher CMI tertiles for both all-cause mortality (log-rank p = 0.0035) and cardiovascular mortality (log-rank p = 0.035). This national cohort study found that CMI is significantly associated with both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among American adults aged over 40. These findings suggest that CMI could be a valuable tool for identifying high-risk individuals, thereby aiding in the implementation of targeted preventive strategies.

abstract: Although metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously termed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, has become the most common chronic liver disorder, its complex pathophysiology has not been fully elucidated up to date. A correlation between elevated sympathetic activation and MASLD has been highlighted in recent preclinical and clinical studies. Furthermore, increased sympathetic activity has been associated with the main mechanisms involved in MASLD, such as lipid accumulation in the liver, insulin resistance, and metabolic dysregulation, while it has been also correlated with the progression of MASLD, leading to liver fibrosis. Preclinical studies demonstrated that therapies which ameliorate the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, such as renal and liver sympathetic denervation, reduce hepatic insulin resistance, decrease hepatic glucose production, and reverse hepatic steatosis in high-fat-diet models. However, data from clinical trials regarding the effect of renal denervation on metabolic parameters are conflicting, since several trials reported a favorable effect, while other trials stated no significant difference, with the profound limitation of the lack of originally designed denervation trials in this setting. Thus, a thorough review of the role of the sympathetic nervous system in the pathophysiology of MASLD, as well as the results of recent sympathetic denervation studies and trials regarding metabolic regulation and MASLD treatment would be of great importance.

abstract: Liver metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related mortality. During the metastasis process, circulating carcinoma cells hardly pass through narrow capillaries, leading to nuclear deformation. However, the effects of nuclear deformation and its underlying mechanisms on metastasis need further study. Here, it is shown that mechanical force-induced nuclear deformation exacerbates liver metastasis by activating the cGAS-STING pathway, which promotes splenocyte infiltration in the liver. Mechanical force results in nuclear deformation and rupture of the nuclear envelope with inevitable DNA leakage. Cytoplasmic DNA triggers the activation of cGAS-STING pathway, enhancing the production of IL6, TNFα, and CCL2. Additionally, splenocyte recruitment by the proinflammatory cytokines support carcinoma cell survival and colonization in the liver. Importantly, both intervening activity of cGAS and blocking of splenocyte migration to the liver efficiently ameliorate liver metastasis. Overall, these findings reveal a mechanism by which mechanical force-induced nuclear deformation exacerbates liver metastasis by regulating splenocyte infiltration into the liver and support targeting cGAS and blocking splenocyte recruitment as candidate therapeutic approaches for liver metastasis.

abstract: ErbB3 is markedly overexpressed in breast cancer cells and is associated with resistance and metastasis. Additionally, ErbB3 expression levels are positively correlated with low densities of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, a marker of poor prognosis. Consequently, ErbB3 is a promising therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we report the generation of ErbB3-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified natural killer (NK) cells by transducing cord blood-derived primary NK cells using vsv-g envelope-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. Transduced cells displayed stable CAR-expressing activity and increased cytotoxicity against ErbB3-positive breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, anti-ErbB3 (aErbB3) CAR-NK cells strongly reduced the tumor burden in the SK-BR-3 xenograft mouse model without observable side effects. These findings underscore the potential of aErbB3 CAR-NK cells as targeted immunotherapy for ErbB3-positive breast cancer, suggesting a promising alternative to conventional treatments.

abstract: Metabolites can double as a signaling modality that initiates physiological adaptations. Metabolism, a chemical language encoding biological information, has been recognized as a powerful principle directing inflammatory responses. Cytosolic pH is a regulator of inflammatory response in macrophages. Here, we found that L-malate exerts anti-inflammatory effect via BiP-IRF2BP2 signaling, which is a sensor of cytosolic pH in macrophages. First, L-malate, a TCA intermediate upregulated in pro-inflammatory macrophages, was identified as a potent anti-inflammatory metabolite through initial screening. Subsequent screening with DARTS and MS led to the isolation of L-malate-BiP binding. Further screening through protein‒protein interaction microarrays identified a L-malate-restrained coupling of BiP with IRF2BP2, a known anti-inflammatory protein. Interestingly, pH reduction, which promotes carboxyl protonation of L-malate, facilitates L-malate and carboxylate analogues such as succinate to bind BiP, and disrupt BiP-IRF2BP2 interaction in a carboxyl-dependent manner. Both L-malate and acidification inhibit BiP-IRF2BP2 interaction, and protect IRF2BP2 from BiP-driven degradation in macrophages. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo, BiP-IRF2BP2 signal is required for effects of both L-malate and pH on inflammatory responses. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized, proton/carboxylate dual sensing pathway wherein pH and L-malate regulate inflammatory responses, indicating the role of certain carboxylate metabolites as adaptors in the proton biosensing by interactions between macromolecules.

      Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are recommended to treat patients with deficient mismatch repair/microsatellite instability high (dMMR/MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Pivotal trials have fixed a maximum ICI duration of 2 years, without a compelling rationale. A shorter treatment duration has the potential to improve patients' quality of life and reduce both toxicity and cost without compromising efficacy. Here we examine whether early treatment discontinuation (ETD) before 13 months in patients without progressive disease (PD) can lead to similar long-term disease control compared with a longer treatment duration (LTD).

abstract: Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are recognized as key factors in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, yet effective interventions and biomarkers to address oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in these conditions are limited. Uric acid (UA), traditionally associated with gout, is now gaining prominence as a potential target in neurodegenerative diseases. Soluble UA stands out as one of the most vital antioxidant compounds produced by the human body, accounting for up to 55% of the extracellular capacity to neutralize free radicals. While there is increasing evidence supporting the neuroprotective properties of UA in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, gaps in knowledge still exist regarding the underlying mechanisms and how to effectively translate these benefits into clinical practice. Moreover, the current UA elevation therapy exhibits unstable antioxidant properties, individual variability, and even adverse effects, limiting its potential clinical applications. This review consolidates recent advancements in understanding how UA exerts neuroprotective effects on neurodegenerative diseases and emphasizes the dual roles of UA in managing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Additionally, the review elucidates the mechanisms through which UA confers neuroprotection. Based on this, the review underscores the significance of UA as a potential biomarker and aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of its potential as a therapeutic target, while also addressing possible challenges to clinical implementation.

abstract: The complement system and neutrophils constitute the two main pillars of the host innate immune defense against infection by bacterial pathogens. Here, we identify T-Mac, a novel virulence factor of the periodontal pathogen Treponema denticola that allows bacteria to evade both defense systems. We show that T-Mac is expressed as a pre-protein that is cleaved into two functional units. The N-terminal fragment has two immunoglobulin-like domains and binds with high affinity to the major neutrophil chemokine receptors FPR1 and CXCR1, blocking N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe- and IL-8-induced neutrophil chemotaxis and activation. The C-terminal fragment functions as a cysteine protease with a unique proteolytic activity and structure, which degrades several components of the complement system, such as C3 and C3b. Murine infection studies further reveal a critical T-Mac role in tissue damage and inflammation caused by bacterial infection. Collectively, these results disclose a novel innate immunity-evasion strategy, and open avenues for investigating the role of cysteine proteases and immunoglobulin-like domains of gram-positive and -negative bacterial pathogens.

abstract: The mechanism(s) underlying gut microbial metabolite (GMM) contribution towards alcohol-mediated cardiovascular disease (CVD) is unknown. Herein we observe elevation in circulating phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), a known CVD-associated GMM, in individuals living with alcohol use disorder. In a male murine binge-on-chronic alcohol model, we confirm gut microbial reorganization, elevation in PAGln levels, and the presence of cardiovascular pathophysiology. Fecal microbiota transplantation from pair-/alcohol-fed mice into naïve male mice demonstrates the transmissibility of PAGln production and the CVD phenotype. Independent of alcohol exposure, pharmacological-mediated increases in PAGln elicits direct cardiac and vascular dysfunction. PAGln induced hypercontractility and altered calcium cycling in isolated cardiomyocytes providing evidence of improper relaxation which corresponds to elevated filling pressures observed in vivo. Furthermore, PAGln directly induces vascular endothelial cell activation through induction of oxidative stress leading to endothelial cell dysfunction. We thus reveal that the alcohol-induced microbial reorganization and resultant GMM elevation, specifically PAGln, directly contributes to CVD.

abstract: Successful immunotherapy relies on both intratumoral and systemic immunity, which is yet to be achieved for most patients with cancer. Here, we identify P4HA1, encoding prolyl 4-hydroxylase 1, as a crucial regulator of CD8+ T cell differentiation strongly upregulated in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) and hypoxic tumor microenvironment. P4HA1 accumulates in mitochondria, disrupting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle through aberrant α-ketoglutarate and succinate metabolism, promoting mitochondria unfitness and exhaustion while suppressing progenitor expansion. Targeting P4HA1 enhances both adoptive and endogenous TCF1+ CD8+ T progenitor expansion while mitigating the development of exhaustion in the tumor, TDLN, and blood, enabling a notable and durable systemic anti-cancer immunity. We propose that P4HA1 induction in CD8+ T cells in cancer orchestrates an immune-escape program, offering a T cell-directed target for system immunotherapy in solid tumors.

abstract: This study shows that five membrane proteins-three GPCRs, an ion channel, and an enzyme-form self-clusters under natural expression levels in a cardiac-derived cell line. The cluster size distributions imply that these proteins self-oligomerize reversibly through weak interactions. When the concentration of the proteins is increased through heterologous expression, the cluster size distributions approach a critical distribution at which point a phase transition occurs, yielding larger bulk phase clusters. A thermodynamic model like that explaining micellization of amphiphiles and lipid membrane formation accounts for this behavior. We propose that many membrane proteins exist as oligomers that form through weak interactions, which we call higher-order transient structures (HOTS). The key characteristics of HOTS are transience, molecular specificity, and a monotonically decreasing size distribution that may become critical at high concentrations. Because molecular specificity invokes self-recognition through protein sequence and structure, we propose that HOTS are genetically encoded supramolecular units.

abstract: Women are disproportionately affected by chronic autoimmune diseases (AD) like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Sjögren's syndrome. Traditional evaluations often underestimate the associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke risk in women having AD. Vitamin D deficiency increases susceptibility to these conditions. CVD risk prediction in AD can benefit from surrogate biomarker for coronary artery disease (CAD), such as carotid ultrasound. Due to non-linearity in the CVD risk stratification, we use artificial intelligence-based system using AD biomarkers and carotid ultrasound. Investigate the relationship between AD and CVD/stroke markers including autoantibody-influenced plaque load. Second, to study the surrogate biomarkers for the CAD and gather radiomics-based features such as carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), and plaque area (PA). Third and final, explore the automated CVD/stroke risk identification using advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) paradigms. Analysed biomarker data from women with AD, including carotid ultrasonography imaging, clinical parameters, autoantibody profiles, and vitamin D levels. Proposed artificial intelligence (AI) models to predict CVD/stroke risk accurately in AD for women. There is a strong association between AD duration and elevated cIMT/PA, with increased CVD risk linked to higher rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs) levels. AI models outperformed conventional methods by integrating imaging data and disorder-specific factors. Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial for managing CVD/stroke in women with chronic autoimmune diseases. AI-based assisted risk stratification methods may improve treatment decision-making and cardiovascular outcomes.

abstract: Large-scale combination drug screens are generally considered intractable due to the immense number of possible combinations. Existing approaches use ad hoc fixed experimental designs then train machine learning models to impute unobserved combinations. Here we propose BATCHIE, an orthogonal approach that conducts experiments dynamically in batches. BATCHIE uses information theory and probabilistic modeling to design each batch to be maximally informative based on the results of previous experiments. On retrospective experiments from previous large-scale screens, BATCHIE designs rapidly discover highly effective and synergistic combinations. In a prospective combination screen of a library of 206 drugs on a collection of pediatric cancer cell lines, the BATCHIE model accurately predicts unseen combinations and detects synergies after exploring only 4% of the 1.4M possible experiments. Further, the model identifies a panel of top combinations for Ewing sarcomas, which follow-up validation experiments confirm to be effective, including the rational and translatable top hit of PARP plus topoisomerase I inhibition. These results demonstrate that adaptive experiments can enable large-scale unbiased combination drug screens with a relatively small number of experiments. BATCHIE is open source and publicly available ( https://github.com/tansey-lab/batchie ).

abstract: One of the key hallmarks of Parkinson's disease is the disruption of lipid homeostasis in the brain, which plays a critical role in neuronal membrane integrity and function. Understanding how treadmill training impacts lipid restructuring and its subsequent influence on motor function could provide a basis for developing targeted non-pharmacological interventions for individuals living with early stage of PD. This study aims to investigate the effects of a treadmill training intervention on motor deficits induced by 6-OHDA in rats model of PD. PD was induced by injecting 6-hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). For 10 weeks, rats underwent treadmill training on a four-lane motorized treadmill. Motor function deficits were evaluated through behavioral tests. Lipidomic analysis was performed through ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC MS/MS). Treadmill intervention significantly improved motor function and restored altered brain and muscle lipid profiles in PD rats. Among the lipid species identified in PD rats, brain abundance was highest for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), correlating positively with the beam-walking scores; muscle abundance peaked with lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPE), correlating positively with grip strength scores. In the brain, the levels of diacylglycerol (DG), triacylglycerol (TG), and lysophosphatidylcholine (PC) correlated positively with grip strength and rotarod scores, while only phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) linked to beam-walking scores. In the muscle, the levels of phosphatidylinositol (PI), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (PE), lysophosphatidic acid (PA), ceramide (Cer), and ganglioside were positively correlated with grip strength and rotarod scores. In conclusion, treadmill may protect the cortex, mitigating motor deficits via change lipid profiles in the brain and muscle.

abstract: Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy globally. Despite its reputation as an aggressive and fatal disease, recent advancements in treatment have significantly improved patient outcomes. Over the past decade, innovative therapies with fewer side effects have emerged, including proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib), monoclonal antibodies (e.g., daratumumab, isatuximab, elotuzumab), immunomodulators (e.g., thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide), and corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone). Additionally, combination regimens utilizing these agents have demonstrated improved efficacy by targeting multiple pathways simultaneously. These therapies are more precise in their ability to attack myeloma cells, leading to enhanced patient quality of life, prolonged remission, and delayed disease progression. This article explores the evolution of MM therapies, highlighting the potential for a cure through ongoing breakthroughs in drug development and combination treatments. The analysis underscores the optimism surrounding the future of MM treatment and the need for continued research to make MM a manageable and potentially curable disease.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designated MDMA-Assisted Therapy (MDMA-AT) as a Breakthrough Therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 2017, and the FDA is requiring an additional phase 3 trial after rejecting the initial New Drug Application in 2024. Unlike other psychedelics, MDMA uniquely induces prosocial subjective effects of heightened trust and self-compassion while maintaining ego functioning as well as cognitive and perceptual lucidity. While recreational use in nonmedical settings may still cause harm, especially due to adulterants or when used without proper precautions, conclusions that can be drawn from studies of recreational use are limited by many confounds. This especially limits the extent to which evidence related to recreational use can be extrapolated to therapeutic use. A considerable body of preliminary evidence suggests that MDMA-AT delivered in a controlled clinical setting is a safe and efficacious treatment for PTSD. After a course of MDMA-AT involving three MDMA administrations supported by psychotherapy, 67%-71% of individuals with PTSD no longer meet diagnostic criteria after MDMA-AT versus 32%-48% with placebo-assisted therapy, and effects endure at long-term follow-up. This review primarily aims to distinguish evidence of recreational use in nonclinical settings versus MDMA-AT using pharmaceutical-grade MDMA in controlled clinical settings. This review further describes the putative neurobiological mechanisms of MDMA underlying its therapeutic effects, the clinical evidence of MDMA-AT, considerations at the level of public health and policy, and future research directions.

abstract: Canonical autophagy captures within specialized double-membrane organelles, termed autophagosomes, an array of cytoplasmic components destined for lysosomal degradation. An autophagosome is completed when the growing phagophore undergoes ESCRT-dependent membrane closure, a prerequisite for its subsequent fusion with endolysosomal organelles and degradation of the sequestered cargo. ATG9A, a key integral membrane protein of the autophagy pathway, is best known for its role in the formation and expansion of phagophores. Here, we report a hitherto unappreciated function of mammalian ATG9A in directing autophagosome closure. ATG9A partners with IQGAP1 and key ESCRT-III component CHMP2A to facilitate this final stage in autophagosome formation. Thus, ATG9A is a central hub governing all major aspects of autophagosome membrane biogenesis, from phagophore formation to its closure, and is a unique ATG factor with progressive functionalities affecting the physiological outputs of autophagy.

abstract: Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by both motor and cognitive features. Motor symptoms primarily involve midbrain dopaminergic neurons, while cognitive dysfunction involves cortical neurons. Environmental factors are important contributors to PD risk. In rodents, rare midbrain dopaminergic neurons which co-express the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGlut2) are resistant to various toxins which induce dopaminergic neurodegeneration. However, it is unclear how, and with what degree of specificity, cortical glutamatergic neurons respond to PD-associated exposures with respect to vGlut2. Here, we found that vGlut2 in stem cell derived human cortical-like glutamatergic neurons was upregulated in a highly specific manner to certain PD-related chemicals, such as rotenone, but not others, such as paraquat. Further, exposure to recombinant pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) of alpha-synuclein (αS), a protein which accumulates in PD, also increased vGlut2, while fibrils from non-PD related proteins did not. This effect did not involve templated aggregation of endogenous αS. Finally, knockdown of vGlut2 sensitized cortical neurons to rotenone, supporting a functional role in resilience. Thus, upregulation of vGlut2 occurs in a highly selective manner in response to specific PD-associated exposures in a model of cortical glutamatergic neurons, a key cell type for understanding PD dementia.

abstract: Patients undergoing dialysis are at risk of osteoporosis and sarcopenia because of mineral and bone disorders or malnutrition. Additionally, maintaining muscle mass is important to prevent osteoporosis. The psoas muscle mass index (PMI) was recently used to evaluate muscle mass. However, few studies have evaluated the association between the PMI and bone mineral density (BMD); therefore, we examined the association between PMI and BMD in the femoral neck (FN) of 80 patients (45 males, age, 71 (60-76) years; dialysis duration, 74 (36-140) months) undergoing hemodialysis. FN-BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and PMI was evaluated using psoas muscle areas on computed tomography. FN-BMD and PMI were significantly higher in males than in females. In a correlation analysis, sex, BMI, serum creatinine levels, HbA1c levels, and PMI were positively correlated with FN-BMD, whereas age, history of bone fracture, difficulty in walking and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase level were negatively correlated. In the multivariate regression analysis using clinical factors significantly correlated to FN-BMD, including PMI, both sex (standardized coefficient: 0.249, p = 0.028) and PMI (standardized coefficient: 0.249, p = 0.038) were extracted. Multivariable linear regression analysis using PMI and traditional osteoporosis factors revealed that PMI was significantly and independently associated with FN-BMD (standardized coefficient: 0.308, p = 0.010). In conclusion, PMI was positively associated with FN-BMD. Attention should be paid to the possibility of decreased BMD with decreased muscle mass.

abstract: Synthetic genetic circuits program the cellular input-output relationships to execute customized functions. However, efforts to scale up these circuits have been hampered by the limited number of reliable regulatory mechanisms with high programmability, performance, predictability and orthogonality. Here we report a class of split-intron-enabled trans-splicing riboregulators (SENTRs) based on de novo designed external guide sequences. SENTR libraries provide low leakage expression, wide dynamic range, high predictability with machine learning and low crosstalk at multiple component levels. SENTRs can sense RNA targets, process signals by logic computation and transduce them into various outputs, either mRNAs or noncoding RNAs. We subsequently demonstrate that digital logic operation with up to six inputs can be implemented using multiple orthogonal SENTRs to regulate a single gene simultaneously and coupling SENTRs with split intein-mediated protein trans-splicing. SENTR represents a powerful and versatile regulatory tool at the post-transcriptional level in Escherichia coli, suggesting broad biotechnological applications.

abstract: Background: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is the most common post-transcriptional modifications, which is critical for the metabolism of ferroptosis-related RNAs. Yet, the impact of m6A modification on ferroptosis in cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is far from clear. Methods: Public databases and tissue arrays were applied to explore the clinical relevance of METTL16 in CC. Then, the effects of METTL16 on growth and ferroptosis were studied in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, RNA-sequencing, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase reporter assays and RNA stability assays were used to identify the METTL16/ATF4 axis in ferroptosis in CC. Results: Clinically, we find that METTL16 is overexpressed and associated with a poor prognosis in patients with CC. Functionally, METTL16 protects against ferroptosis by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, including mitochondrial structure, membrane potential and energy products. It also decreases cellular metabolism of Fe2+ and lipid peroxide, thereby promoting cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ATF4 is a novel target of METTL16 and METTL16 enhances the m6A level and expression of ATF4 mRNA by inhibiting its decay, which further prevented ferroptosis in CC via m6A modification. Conclusions: Our findings highlighted the role of METTL16/ATF4 in ferroptosis, which sheds light on potential therapeutic strategies for CC.

abstract: Background: Dual-specificity phosphatase 3 (DUSP3) is a small-molecule dual-specificity phosphatase whose function has not yet been elucidated. This study investigated the effects of DUSP3 on the biological behavior of osteosarcoma and its potential mechanisms. Methods: We performed bioinformatics analysis of DUSP3 using "The Cancer Genome Atlas" and "The Tumor Immune Estimation Resource" databases. The impact of DUSP3 on osteosarcoma biological behavior was evaluated using CCK-8, wound-healing, transwell invasion, and tumor sphere formation assays. Immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the interaction between two proteins. We then established a nude mouse transplantation tumor model to examine the in vivo effects of DUSP3 on osteosarcoma. Results: Overexpression of DUSP3 significantly inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and stemness. Conversely, DUSP3 knockdown yielded the opposite results. In an animal model, we administered subcutaneous injections of 143B osteosarcoma cells overexpressing DUSP3, and the results indicated that the overexpression of DUSP3 impaired osteosarcoma growth. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that DUSP3 could be an independent prognostic determinant in individuals diagnosed with osteosarcoma. Through modulating the EGFR/STAT3/SOX2 axis, DUSP3 restrains osteosarcoma cell growth, migration, invasion, and stemness. Therefore, targeting DUSP3 may serve as an effective therapeutic target in osteosarcoma treatment.

abstract: Glia assess axon structure to modulate myelination and axon repair. Whether glia similarly detect dendrites and their substructures is not well understood. Here we show that glia monitor the integrity of dendrite substructures and transiently protect them against perturbations. We demonstrate that disruption of C. elegans sensory neuron dendrite cilia elicits acute glial responses, including increased accumulation of glia-derived extracellular matrix around cilia, changes in gene expression, and alteration of secreted protein repertoire. DGS-1, a 7-transmembrane domain neuronal protein, and FIG-1, a multifunctional thrombospondin-domain glial protein, are required for glial detection of cilia integrity, physically interact, and exhibit mutually-dependent localization to and around cilia, respectively. Glial responses to dendrite cilia disruption transiently protect against damage. Thus, our studies uncover a homeostatic, protective, dendrite-glia signaling interaction regulating dendrite substructure integrity.

abstract: Virus neutralization profiles against primary infection sera and corresponding antigenic cartography are integral part of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccine strain selection processes. Human single variant exposure sera have previously defined the antigenic relationships among SARS-CoV-2 variants but are now largely unavailable due to widespread population immunity. Therefore, antigenic characterization of future SARS-CoV-2 variants will require an animal model, analogous to using ferrets for influenza virus. We evaluated neutralization profiles against 23 SARS-CoV-2 variants in nonhuman primates (NHPs) after single variant exposure and generated an NHP-derived antigenic map. We identified a distant antigenic region occupied by BA.2.86, JN.1, and the descendants KP.2, KP.3, and KZ.1.1.1. We also found that the monovalent XBB.1.5 mRNA vaccine induced broad immunity against the mapped antigenic space. In addition, substantial concordance was observed between our NHP-derived and two human antigenic maps, demonstrating the utility of NHPs as a surrogate for antigenic cartography in humans.

publication_date: 2025 Jan 3;16(1):135.
abstract: Vangl is a planar cell polarity (PCP) core protein essential for aligned cell orientation along the epithelial plane perpendicular to the apical-basal direction, which is important for tissue morphogenesis, development and collective cell behavior. Mutations in Vangl are associated with developmental defects, including neural tube defects (NTDs), according to human cohort studies of sporadic and familial cases. The complex mechanisms underlying Vangl-mediated PCP signaling or Vangl-associated human congenital diseases have been hampered by the lack of molecular characterizations of Vangl. Here, we show biochemical and structural evidence that human Vangl1 oligomerizes as dimers of trimers, and that the dimerization of trimers promotes binding to the PCP effector Prickle1 (Pk1) in vitro. Mapping of human disease-associated point mutations suggests potential pathological mechanisms and paves the way for future studies on the importance of lipid binding, central vestibule and oligomerization of Vangl, thereby providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of the PCP signaling pathway.

abstract: Osteoporosis and sarcopenia are common diseases in the older. This study aims to use transcriptomics and explore common diagnostic genes of osteoporosis and sarcopenia and predict potentially effective treatment drugs. Three datasets for osteoporosis and sarcopenia were downloaded from the GEO database, and transcriptome sequencing was performed on clinical samples. A total of 23 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected using the LIMMA, WGCNA, and the DEseq2 package. Three machine learning methods were employed to determine the final common diagnostic genes for the diseases. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the predictive performance of genes. Single-gene enrichment analysis (GSEA), immune infiltration abundance calculation, and related metabolic analysis were used to study the pathogenesis of the two diseases. Finally, the CMap database was used to predict potential therapeutic drugs for the diseases, and further validation was conducted through RT-PCR and WB. Three genes for the diseases CHST3, PGBD5, and SLIT2 were identified, showing good predictive performance in both internal and external validations. GSEA analysis revealed that genes were enriched primarily in pathways related to cell cycle regulation, fatty acid metabolism, DNA replication, and carbohydrate synthesis. CHST3 and SLIT2 were involved in the immune response, but PGBD5 seemed unrelated to the immune response. Potential therapeutic drugs were predicted, and the RT-PCR, WB results further validated our hypotheses. CHST3, PGBD5, and SLIT2 can serve as potential genes for the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis and sarcopenia; furthermore, these results provide new clues for further experimental research and treatment.

abstract: Donor-derived fecal microbiota treatments are efficacious in preventing recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI), but they have inherently variable quality attributes, are difficult to scale and harbor the risk of pathogen transfer. In contrast, VE303 is a defined consortium of eight purified, clonal bacterial strains developed for prevention of rCDI. In the phase 2 CONSORTIUM study, high-dose VE303 was well tolerated and reduced the odds of rCDI by more than 80% compared to placebo. VE303 organisms robustly colonized the gut in the high-dose group and were among the top taxa associated with non-recurrence. Multi-omic modeling identified antibiotic history, baseline stool metabolites and serum cytokines as predictors of both on-study CDI recurrence and VE303 colonization. VE303 potentiated early recovery of the host microbiome and metabolites with increases in short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids and bile salt hydrolase genes after antibiotic treatment for CDI, which is considered important to prevent CDI recurrences. These results support the idea that VE303 promotes efficacy in rCDI through multiple mechanisms.

Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among pregnant and pre-pregnancy women, which increases the risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a common complication during pregnancy. Recent studies have explored various aspects of the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and GDM, including the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects glucose metabolism, the role of the vitamin D receptor gene, and the impact of routine vitamin D supplementation before and during pregnancy. This paper will review the current research progress in these areas.

abstract: Propagation of intercellular calcium waves through tissues has been found to coordinate different multicellular responses. Nevertheless, our understanding of how calcium waves operate remains limited. In this study, we explore the real-time dynamics of intercellular calcium waves in Drosophila adipose tissues. We identify Adipokinetic Hormone (AKH), the fly functional homolog of glucagon, as the key factor driving Ca2+ activities in adipose tissue. We find that AKH, which is released into the hemolymph from the AKH-producing neurosecretory cells, stimulates calcium waves in the larval fat by a previously unrecognized gap-junction-independent mechanism to promote lipolysis. In the adult fat body, however, gap-junction-dependent intercellular calcium waves are triggered by a presumably uniformly diffused AKH. Additionally, we discover that amino acids activate the AKH-producing neurosecretory cells, leading to increased intracellular Ca2+ and AKH secretion. Altogether, we show that dietary amino acids regulate the AKH release from the AKH-producing neurosecretory cells in the brain, which subsequently stimulates gap-junction-independent intercellular calcium waves in adipose tissue, enhancing lipid metabolism.

abstract: As immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapy has made great strides in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment, improving patient response to this strategy has become the main focus of research. Accumulating evidence has shown that m6A methylation plays a crucial role in the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC, while the precise impact of the m6A demethylase ALKBH5 on the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of HCC remains poorly defined. The clinical significance of ALKBH5 and TIM3 were evaluated in human HCC tissues. The biological function of ALKBH5 was analyzed in vitro and in vivo. The HCC molecular subtypes were identified based on key ALKBH5-regulated methylation-related genes (MRGs). The differences in survival, clinical features, TIME and immunotherapy response between these two subtypes were then evaluated. The regulation of ALKBH5 on TIM3 was detected by qPCR, western blotting and MeRIP. ALKBH5 was downregulated in HCC and associated with worse prognosis. ALKBH5 inhibited the proliferation and migration activities of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. The HCC subtype with high expression of key MRGs was characterized by immunosuppression phenotypes and a worse response to ICIs. Moreover, TIM3 was identified as a target of ALKBH5. Upregulated TIM3 level was negatively correlated with survival in HCC. The results of this study suggest that ALKBH5 is an important regulator in HCC progression. ALKBH5 exerts its influence on the TIME and immunotherapy response by targeting TIM3 in HCC. This work provides new insight into the correlation between m6A modification and ICI response, which may help provide therapeutic benefits to HCC patients.

abstract: Lung cancer treatment is evolving, and the role of senescent macrophages in tumor immune evasion has become a key focus. This study explores how senescent macrophages interact with lung cancer cells, contributing to tumor progression and immune dysfunction. As aging impairs macrophage functions, including phagocytosis and metabolic signaling, it promotes chronic inflammation and cancer development. p16INK4a-positive macrophages are common in aged mice, and their clearance slows tumor growth, suggesting these cells support tumor proliferation and immune evasion. Targeting the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and reprogramming senescent macrophages offers potential therapeutic benefits, including reversing immune aging and boosting anti-tumor immunity. However, translating these findings into clinical practice requires further molecular understanding and rigorous clinical trials.

abstract: Despite significant progress in skin wound healing, it is still a challenge to construct multifunctional bioactive dressings based on a highly aligned protein fiber coated hydrogel matrix for antifibrosis skin wound regeneration that is indistinguishable to native skin. In this study, a "dual-wheel-driven" strategy is adopted to modify the surface of methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) hydrogel with highly aligned magnetic nanocomposites-protein fiber assemblies (MPF) consisting of photothermal responsive antibacteria superparamagnetic nanocomposites-fibrinogen (Fg) complexes as the building blocks. Whole-phase healing properties of the modified hydrogel dressing, GelMA-MPF (GMPF), stem from the integration of Fg protein with RGD peptide activity decorated on the surface of the antibacterial magnetic nanoactuator, facilitating facile and reproducible dressing preparation by self-assembly and involving biochemical, morphological, and biophysical cues. Payload and substantial release of copper ions for in situ catalytic production of nitric oxide (NO) from the fiber inorganic skeleton adsorbed by Fg molecules collectively regulate the proliferation, migration, reorganization, and transdifferentiation behavior of fibroblasts and fulfill antifibrosis in the process of skin wound healing and subcutaneous appendage regeneration. In full-thickness skin lesion mouse models, the complete regeneration of skin tissue with regenerated hair follicle cells and capillary blood vessels is realized in a temporally and spatially ordered manner.

publication_date: 2025 Jan 2.
abstract: Impaired insulin receptor signaling is strongly linked to obesity-related metabolic conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). However, the exact mechanisms behind impaired insulin receptor (INSR) signaling in obesity induced by a high-fat diet remain elusive. In this study, we identify an E3 ubiquitin ligase, tripartite motif-containing protein 32 (TRIM32), as a key regulator of hepatic insulin signaling that targets the insulin receptor (INSR) for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in high-fat diet (HFD) mice. HFD induces the nuclear translocation of SREBP-1c (Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein 1c), resulting in increased expression of TRIM32 in hepatocytes. TRIM32 ubiquitylates INSR and facilitates its proteasomal degradation, leading to severe insulin resistance and fat accumulation within the liver of high-fat diet induced obese (DIO) mice. Conversely, liver-specific knockdown of TRIM32 enhances INSR expression and hepatic insulin sensitivity. Reduced AMPK signaling and phosphorylation of SREBP-1c at S372 in high-fat DIO mice promotes the nuclear translocation of SREBP-1c, leading to increased TRIM32 expression. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that TRIM32 promotes diet-induced hepatic insulin resistance by targeting the INSR to degradation.

abstract: Dysfunctional tumor vasculature, hypoxia, and an immunosuppressive microenvironment are significant barriers to effective cancer therapy. Autophagy, which is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and apoptosis resistance, is primarily triggered by hypoxia and nutrient deprivation, conditions prevalent in dysfunctional tumor vessels due to poor circulation. However, the role of autophagy in dysfunctional tumor endothelial cells and its impact on treatment and the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain poorly understood. Methods: We used multiplex immunofluorescence and transgene-based imaging to characterize autophagy in endothelial cells from clinical tumor samples, zebrafish xenograft tumors, and murine models. Using a zebrafish xenograft vasculature platform, we analyzed the effects of autophagy inhibitors on the structure and function of the tumor vasculature. In mice, we investigated autophagy inhibition via endothelial-specific autophagy gene knockout (Atg7 iECKO) and the autophagy inhibitor SBI-0206965 and evaluated the synergistic effects of combining SBI-0206965 with low-dose chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, 5-FU) or PD-1 antibody. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured in vitro under hypoxic, glucose-deprived, and serum-free conditions to simulate dysfunctional tumor endothelial cells and to explore the mechanisms by which autophagy inhibition optimizes tumor vasculature. Results: Elevated autophagy was observed in tumor endothelial cells within the dysfunctional vasculature. Autophagy inhibition, through either genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition, selectively prunes dysfunctional vessels and improves vascular function. It also stimulates the formation of a perivascular immune niche, thereby optimizing the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME). Furthermore, combining the autophagy inhibitor SBI-0206965 with low-dose 5-FU or PD-1 antibody potentiated the anti-tumor effects. Mechanistic studies have indicated that autophagy acts as a protective response to the hypoxic and nutrient-deprived TME, while its inhibition, mediated by p53 activation, promotes tumor endothelial cell apoptosis in dysfunctional tumor vessels, further optimizing the structure and function of the tumor vasculature. Conclusions: Targeting endothelial cell autophagy is a promising strategy for remodeling the dysfunctional tumor vasculature, optimizing the TiME, and boosting the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

abstract: Various mature tissue-resident cells exhibit progenitor characteristics following injury. However, the existence of endogenous stem cells with multiple lineage potentials in the adult spinal cord remains a compelling area of research. In this study, we present a cross-species investigation that extends from development to injury. We used single-nucleus transcriptomic sequencing and genetic lineage tracing to characterize neural cells in the spinal cord. Our findings show that ciliated ependymal cells lose neural progenitor gene signatures and proliferation ability following the differentiation of NPCs within the ventricular zone. By combining single-nucleus transcriptome datasets from the rhesus macaque spinal cord injury (SCI) model with developmental human spinal cord datasets, we revealed that ciliated ependymal cells respond minimally to injury and cannot revert to a developmental progenitor state. Intriguingly, we observed astrocytes transdifferentiating into mature oligodendrocytes postinjury through lineage tracing experiments. Further analysis identifies an intermediate-state glial cell population expressing both astrocyte and oligodendrocyte feature genes in adult spinal cords. The transition ratio from astrocytes into oligodendrocytes increased after remodeling injury microenvironment by functional scaffolds. Overall, our results highlight the remarkable multilineage potential of astrocytes in the adult spinal cord.

abstract: Lung neuroendocrine neoplasms are a group of diverse, heterogeneous tumours that range from well-differentiated, low-grade neuroendocrine tumours-such as typical and atypical carcinoids-to high-grade, poorly differentiated aggressive malignancies, such as large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). While the incidence of SCLC has decreased, the worldwide incidence of other pulmonary neuroendocrine neoplasms has been increasing over the past decades. In addition to the standard histopathological classification of lung neuroendocrine neoplasms, the introduction of molecular and sequencing techniques has led to new advances in understanding the biology of these diseases and might influence future classifications and staging that can subsequently improve management guidelines in the adjuvant or metastatic settings. Due to the rarity of neuroendocrine neoplasms, there is a paucity of prospective studies that focus on the lungs, especially in rare, well-differentiated carcinoids and LCNECs. In contrast with the success of targeted therapies in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung often only have a few specific targetable gene alterations. Optimal therapy for LCNECs is not well defined and treatment recommendations are based on extrapolating guidelines for the management of patients with SCLC and NSCLC. This Review explores the epidemiology, diagnosis, and staging of lung neuroendocrine neoplasms to date. In addition, we focus on the evolving molecular landscape and biomarkers, ranging from tumour phenotypes to functional imaging studies and novel molecular biomarkers. We outline the various clinical outcomes, challenges, the treatment landscape, ongoing clinical trials, and future directions.

abstract: Psoriasis is a long-lasting inflammatory skin condition characterized by excessive keratinocyte growth. Recent studies have confirmed abnormal regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) in individuals with psoriasis. This study aimed to investigate the function and specific mechanism of action of miR-128a-3p in interleukin-22 (IL-22)-stimulated HaCaT cells. The expression level of miR-128-3p and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1α) was detected using qRT-PCR on patients with psoriasis and IL-22-treated HaCaT cell model. Western blotting was used to detect apoptosis-associated proteins and SIRT1/HIFα pathway protein expression levels. The cell viability was determined using the CCK-8 method. Flow cytometry was performed to detect apoptosis following IL-22 stimulation or transfection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect cellular inflammatory factor secretion. The relationship between miR-128-3p and SIRT1 was predicted using the Starbase database and verified using a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. In patients with psoriasis and IL-22-stimulated HaCaT cells, miR-128-3p and HIF-1α expression levels were elevated and SIRT1 expression was decreased. miR-128-3p directly targeted SIRT1. IL-22 stimulation significantly elevated cell viability, inhibited apoptosis levels and cleaved-caspase3 protein expression, and promoted an inflammatory response in HaCaT cells, which was further promoted by the miR-128-3p mimic. The miR-128-3p inhibitor reduced cell viability, promoted cell apoptosis and cleaved-caspase3 protein expression, and inhibited the inflammatory response in IL-22-induced HaCaT cells; these effects were at least partly reversed by SIRT1-siRNA. miR-128-3p expression is elevated in psoriasis and promotes psoriasis progression by inhibiting SIRT1 expression.

abstract: Protein glycosylation, which involves the addition of carbohydrate chains to amino acid side chains, imparts essential properties to proteins, offering immense potential in synthetic biology applications. Despite its importance, natural glycosylation pathways present several limitations, highlighting the need for new tools to better understand glycan structures, recognition, metabolism, and biosynthesis, and to facilitate the production of biologically relevant glycoproteins. The field of bacterial glycoengineering has gained significant attention due to the ongoing discovery and study of bacterial glycosylation systems. By utilizing protein glycan coupling technology, a wide range of valuable glycoproteins for clinical and diagnostic purposes have been successfully engineered. This review outlines the recent advances in bacterial protein glycosylation from the perspective of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, focusing on the development of new glycoprotein therapeutics and vaccines. We provide an overview of the production of high-value, customized glycoproteins using prokaryotic glycosylation platforms, with particular emphasis on four key elements: (i) glycosyltransferases, (ii) carrier proteins, (iii) glycosyl donors, and (iv) host bacteria. Optimization of these elements enables precise control over glycosylation patterns, thus enhancing the potential of the resulting products. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future prospects of leveraging synthetic biology technologies to develop microbial glyco-factories and cell-free systems for efficient glycoprotein production.

      Statin therapy reduces the risk of ischemic stroke; however, certain studies have observed an increased incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Moreover, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9(PCSK-9) inhibitors have emerged as a powerful class of lipid-lowering medications, potentially with a lower propensity for causing hemorrhagic events. To investigate this matter further, we conducted a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving statins and PCSK-9 inhibitors that reported occurrences of ICH.

abstract: The accurate assembly of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex is fundamental for the replication and transcription of rhabdoviruses, which are known for their broad pathogenic impact. A novel 119-amino-acid protein, NLRP12-119aa is identified, encoded by the circular RNA circNLRP12, that effectively disrupts the formation of rhabdovirus RNP complexes through two distinct mechanisms and significantly reduces their replication. NLRP12-119aa exhibits a strong affinity for the conserved 18-nucleotide sequence at the start of the leader RNA of rhabdoviruses VSV, SCRV, and RABV, outcompeting their native N protein interactions, thereby disrupting the assembly of RNP complexes and inhibiting viral replication. NLRP12-119aa exerts anti-rhabdoviral effects by directly binding to the viral N protein, leading to its destabilization and accelerated degradation, and consequently hindering the formation of the viral RNP complex. To assess the therapeutic potential of circNLRP12 against rhabdovirus infections, a zebrafish model of VSV infection is established and noted a substantial reduction in viral load after-treatment with circNLRP12, as well as the recovery of spleen's to a normalized state from its previously enlarged and hemorrhagic state. Collectively, these findings elucidate a novel dual anti-RNP assembly strategy mediated by NLRP12-119aa, offering valuable insights for further exploration and clinical management of rhabdoviral infections.

abstract: Asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory disease that affects millions globally. Although glucocorticoids are a mainstay of asthma treatment, a subset of patients show resistance to these therapies, resulting in poor disease control and increased morbidity. The complex mechanisms underlying steroid-resistant asthma (SRA) involve Th1 and Th17 lymphocyte activity, neutrophil recruitment, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Recent studies provided evidence that innate lymphoid cells type 3 (ILC3s) might be potential therapeutic targets for non-eosinophilic asthma (NEA) and SRA. Like Th17 cells, ILC3s play crucial roles in immune responses, inflammation, and tissue homeostasis, contributing to disease severity and corticosteroid resistance in NEA. Biologics targeting ILC3-related pathways have shown promise in managing Th2-low asthma, suggesting new avenues for SRA treatment. This review aims to explore the risk factors for SRA, discuss the challenges and mechanisms underlying SRA, consolidate current findings on innate lymphoid cells, and elucidate their role in respiratory conditions. We present the latest findings on the involvement of ILC3s in human diseases and explore their potential mechanisms in SRA development. Furthermore, we review emerging therapeutic biologics targeting ILC3-related pathways in managing NEA and SRA. This review highlights current challenges, and emerging therapeutic strategies, and addresses a significant gap in asthma research, with implications for improving the management of steroid-resistant asthma.

abstract: Non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most prevalent and lethal types of cancers worldwide and its high incidence and mortality rates pose a significant public health challenge. Despite significant advances in targeted therapy and immunotherapy, the overall prognosis of patients with NSCLC remains poor. Hypoxia is a critical driving factor in tumor progression, influencing the biological behavior of tumor cells through complex molecular mechanisms. The present review systematically examined the role of the hypoxic microenvironment in NSCLC, demonstrating its crucial role in promoting tumor cell growth, invasion and metastasis. Additionally, it has been previously reported that the hypoxic microenvironment enhances tumor cell resistance by activating hypoxia‑inducible factor and regulating exosome secretion. The hypoxic microenvironment also enables tumor cells to adapt to low oxygen and nutrient‑deficient conditions by enhancing metabolic reprogramming, such as through upregulating glycolysis. Further studies have shown that the hypoxic microenvironment facilitates immune escape by modulating tumor‑associated immune cells and suppressing the antitumor response of the immune system. Moreover, the hypoxic microenvironment increases tumor resistance to radiotherapy, chemotherapy and other types of targeted therapy through various pathways, significantly reducing the therapeutic efficacy of these treatments. Therefore, it could be suggested that early detection of cellular hypoxia and targeted therapy based on hypoxia may offer new therapeutic approaches for patients with NSCLC. The present review not only deepened the current understanding of the mechanisms of action and role of the hypoxic microenvironment in NSCLC but also provided a solid theoretical basis for the future development of precision treatments for patients with NSCLC.

abstract: Growing evidence suggests that serotonin is an important mediator in the cross-talk between immune and bone cells, playing a role in the pathogenesis of various types of inflammatory arthritis (IA). However, the relationship between circulating serotonin and different outcomes in three most prevalent IA - rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), remains limited and requires further investigation. This study was performed to evaluate variations in serotonin serum levels among RA, PsA, and axSpA and to explore the utility of this biochemical marker in the assessment of disease activity and health status measurements provided by the Multi-Dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ). This was a cross-sectional study using data from the PolNorRHEUMA registry. Demographic and clinical data, as well as blood samples, were collected during routine visits to the rheumatology outpatient clinic. We included 60 patients (20 with RA, 20 with PsA, and 20 with axSpA) and 45 healthy controls, with a mean age of 49 years and 56.2% female. A reliable liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method was used for the quantitative determination of serotonin in blood serum. Analysis of serotonin levels, based on 105 observations and adjusted for age, SSRI/SNRI intake and physical activity, revealed a significant elevation in the patient groups compared with the controls (p < 0.001): 134.00 ng/mL in healthy controls vs. 176.00 ng/mL in RA, 183 ng/mL in PsA, and 184.00 ng/mL in axSpA, with no statistically significant differences between the respective forms of IA. We found no significant correlation between the serotonin concentration and disease activity composite scores. A sample of 51 patients revealed a significant positive correlation between the serotonin concentration and global MDHAQ scores (β = 0.01, p = 0.009), indicating that an increase in serotonin levels is associated with worsening patient-reported health status. The serotonin serum concentration was higher in patients with RA, PsA, and axSpA than in controls, indicating its potential as a biomarker of inflammation and worse health status. The LC-MS method was successfully applied for the analysis of serum.

abstract: Basketball is an intense, fast-paced game that is physically, highly demanding. Certain aspects of the game, such as the quick pivoting and cutting movements, predispose the players to serious knee injuries, including anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. While an ACL tear can be a devastating condition for players, multidisciplinary management of the injury can provide the players with a reasonable chance to return to play at the pre-injury level. This article aims to review the general principles and guidelines for the management of ACL injury in basketball players. The diagnosis, surgical treatment, rehabilitation and return to sports are discussed from European and North American perspectives. With a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to this condition, medical professionals can provide injured basketball players with a favourable prognosis for returning to play at the pre-injury level. To return to normal life and basketball after ACL reconstruction, the proposed approach includes (1) the selection of the appropriate surgical graft and technique, (2) maintaining a healthy and persistent mental state during rehabilitation, and (3) following a scientific rehabilitation programme based on personalized recovery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V.

abstract: Leishmania presents a complex life cycle that involves both invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. By regulating gene expression, protein synthesis, and metabolism, the parasite can adapt to various environmental conditions. This regulation occurs mainly at the post-transcriptional level and may involve epitranscriptomic modifications of RNAs. Recent studies have shown that mRNAs in humans undergo a modification known as N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) catalyzed by the enzyme N-acetyltransferase (NAT10), impacting mRNAs stability and translation. Here, we characterized the NAT10 homologue of L. mexicana, finding that the enzyme exhibits all the conserved acetyltransferase domains although failed to functionally complement the Kre33 mutant in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We also discovered that LmexNAT10 is nuclear, and seems essential, as evidenced by unsuccessful attempts to obtain null mutant parasites. Phenotypic characterization of single-knockout parasites revealed that LmexNAT10 affects the multiplication of procyclic forms and the promastigote-amastigote differentiation. Additionally, in vivo infection studies using the invertebrate vector Lutzomyia longipalpis showed a delay in the parasite differentiation into metacyclics. Finally, we observed changes in the cell cycle progression and protein synthesis in the mutant parasites. Together, these results suggest that LmexNAT10 might be important for parasite differentiation, potentially by regulating ac4C levels.

abstract: This cross-sectional, nationwide, population-based study aimed to elucidate sex differences in psychiatric comorbidities of Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) across children, adolescents, and adults. We analyzed data from Taiwan's comprehensive healthcare database, including 112,225 individuals diagnosed with ADHD, categorized by age (0-12, 13-18, ≥18 years) and sex. Psychiatric comorbidities were assessed using ICD-9-CM codes, focusing on age and sex-specific prevalence. Among the cohort, 83.50% were children (0-12 years) presenting primarily with learning disabilities and tics, while adolescents (13-18 years; 11.88%) had higher instances of oppositional defiant and conduct disorders. In adults (≥18 years; 4.62%), the prevalence of anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and substance misuse was notably higher. Males under 18 predominantly had ADHD, whereas females exhibited increased vulnerability to emotional disorders. In adulthood, males showed greater susceptibility to most psychiatric comorbidities, except sleep disorders. The study highlights the evolving nature of ADHD-related psychiatric comorbidities across different life stages, with distinct sex-based patterns. The transition from childhood to adulthood sees an increased prevalence of various psychiatric conditions, particularly impacting adult males. These findings underscore the need for age- and sex-specific therapeutic approaches in ADHD management. The cultural context of the study necessitates further research in diverse populations for broader applicability of the findings.

abstract: The motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating condition with limited treatment options. The past few years have witnessed a ramping up of translational ALS research, offering the prospect of disease-modifying therapies. Although breakthroughs using gene-targeted approaches have shown potential to treat patients with specific disease-causing mutations, the applicability of such therapies remains restricted to a minority of individuals. Therapies targeting more general mechanisms that underlie motor neuron pathology in ALS are therefore of considerable interest. ALS pathology is associated with disruption to a complex array of key cellular pathways, including RNA processing, proteostasis, metabolism and inflammation. This Review details attempts to restore cellular homeostasis by targeting these pathways in order to develop effective, broadly-applicable ALS therapeutics.

abstract: Cellular and gene therapy (CGT) products have emerged as a popular approach in regenerative medicine, showing promise in treating various pancreatic and liver diseases in numerous clinical trials. Before these therapies can be tested in human clinical trials, it is essential to evaluate their safety and efficacy in relevant animal models. Such preclinical testing is often required to obtain regulatory approval for investigational new drugs. However, there is a lack of detailed guidance on selecting appropriate animal models for CGT therapies targeting specific pancreatic and liver conditions, such as pancreatitis and chronic liver diseases. In this review, the gastrointestinal committee for the International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy provides a summary of current recommendations for animal species and disease model selection, as outlined by the US Food and Drug Administration, with references to EU EMA and Japan PMDA. We discuss a range of small and large animal models, as well as humanized models, that are suitable for preclinical testing of CGT products aimed at treating pancreatic and liver diseases. For each model, we cover the associated pathophysiology, commonly used metrics for assessing disease status, the pros and limitations of the models, and the relevance of these models to human conditions. We also summarize the use and application of humanized mouse and other animal models in evaluating the safety and efficacy of CGT products. This review aims to provide comprehensive guidance for selecting appropriate animal species and models to help bridge the gap between the preclinical research and clinical trials using CGT therapies for specific pancreatic and liver diseases.

abstract: Rationale: It remains unclear why unilateral proximal carotid artery occlusion (UCAO) causes benign oligemia in mice, yet leads to various outcomes (asymptomatic-to-death) in humans. We hypothesized that inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) both transforms UCAO-mediated oligemia into full infarction and expands pre-existing infarction. Methods: Using 900 mice, we i) investigated stroke-related effects of UCAO with/without intraperitoneal administration of the NOS inhibitor (NOSi) Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 400 mg/kg); ii) examined the rescue effect of the NO-donor, molsidomine (200 mg/kg at 30 minutes); and iii) tested the impact of antiplatelet medications. To corroborate preclinical findings, we conducted clinical studies. Results: UCAO alone induced infarction rarely (~2%) or occasionally (~14%) in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, respectively. However, L-NAME+UCAO induced large-arterial infarction in ~75% of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. Six-hour laser-speckle imaging detected spreading ischemia in ~40% of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice with infarction (vs. none without) by 24-hours. In agreement with vasoconstriction/microthrombus formation shown by intravital-microscopy, molsidomine and the endothelial-NOS-activating antiplatelet cilostazol attenuated/prevented progression to infarction. Moreover, UCAO without L-NAME caused infarction in ~22% C57BL/6 and ~31% ApoE knock-out mice with hyperglycemia/hyperlipidemia, which associated with ~60% greater levels of symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA, an endogenous NOSi). Further, increased levels of glucose and cholesterol associated with significantly larger infarct volumes in 438 UCAO-stroke patients. Lastly, Mendelian randomization identified a causative role of NOS inhibition (elevated SDMA concentration) in ischemic stroke risk (OR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.11-1.38; P = 7.69×10-5). Conclusion: NOS activity determines the fate of hypoperfused brain following acute UCAO, where SDMA could be a potential risk predictor.

abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) presents significant treatment challenges due to its complex etiology and late-stage diagnosis. The traditional Chinese medicine Selaginella doederleinii Hieron (S. doederleinii) has shown potentiality in NPC treatment due to its multi-target, multi-pathway anti-cancer mechanisms. First, we identified NPC related target genes from databases like GeneCards, OMIM, and DisGeNET, and performed WGCNA analysis on the GSE53819 dataset to identify several important gene modules related to NPC. Active components and their targets in S. doederleinii were screened from the TCMSP and other databases, identifying 32 overlapping genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that these genes are primarily involved in critical biological processes like protein phosphorylation and cell cycle regulation. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed, and cytoHubba identified six key genes (BCL2, MAPK14, ABCB1, PLK1, ATM, HMOX1). Kaplan-Meier analysis and immune infiltration analysis further showed that these key genes are closely related to the prognosis and immune microenvironment of NPC patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed the expression distribution of key genes across different immune cell types and explored their roles in the differentiation process of malignant cells through pseudotime trajectory analysis. Molecular docking and dynamics simulation results indicated that the Berberine-MAPK14 and Matairesinol-PLK1 complexes have high binding affinity and stability. Binding free energy calculations confirmed the stability of these complexes. Based on our comprehensive multi-level analysis, the active components of S. doederleinii may play a significant role in the treatment of NPC through multi-pathway and multi-target synergistic effects.

abstract: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients is associated with end-stage renal disease and significant economic burden. While sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) show renal benefits in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), their cost-effectiveness in Thailand remains unclear. This study evaluates the cost-utility of adding SGLT2i (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and canagliflozin) to standard of care therapy (SoCT) for T2D patients with CKD in Thailand. A lifetime Markov model assessed economic and clinical outcomes. Data were derived from Thai studies, RCT subgroup analyses, and patient interviews. Sensitivity analysis was performed. Adding SGLT2i increased life expectancy (0.42-0.52 years) and QALYs (3.83- 3.91 vs. 3.50 with SoCT alone), but also increased lifetime costs ($1,275-$1,903). Empagliflozin was cost-effective at a WTP threshold of $4,336 per QALY ($3,386/QALY), while dapagliflozin ($5,783/QALY) and canagliflozin ($4,591/QALY) required price reductions. SGLT2i showed potential cost savings for dialysis and kidney transplantation compared to SoCT alone. Adding SGLT2i to SoCT for T2D and CKD patients increases costs but provides significant clinical benefits. Empagliflozin is cost-effective at a WTP threshold of $4,336/QALY, while dapagliflozin and canagliflozin require price reductions to be cost-effective. However, the analysis solely focuses on renal benefits, excluding other advantages like cardiovascular and heart failure protection.

abstract: CXCL14 is a highly conserved chemokine expressed in various cell types, playing crucial roles in both physiological and pathological processes, including immune regulation and tumorigenesis. Recently, the role of CXCL14 in tumors has attracted considerable attention. However, previous pan-cancer studies have reported inconsistencies regarding the effects of CXCL14 on tumors, particularly concerning its expression levels in tumor tissues and its influence on various phenotypes of cancer cells. This variability is believed to stem from the context-dependent nature of CXCL14, as different sources of CXCL14 and its secretion within distinct tumor microenvironments may mediate diverse biological effects. Such phenomena have also been observed in prostate cancer research. Despite a foundational understanding of CXCL14 in prostate cancer, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews summarizing the specific roles of this chemokine and systematically analyzing the reasons behind its complex effects. Therefore, this article aims to discuss the role of CXCL14 in the tumor microenvironment of prostate cancer and explore future research directions and potential applications.

abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome affecting 20-30 % of the adult population worldwide. This disease, which includes simple steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, poses a significant risk for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Lifestyle modifications are crucial in the treatment of NAFLD; however, patient adherence remains challenging. As there is no specific treatment, drug repositioning is being researched as an alternative strategy. Statins, which are known for their cholesterol-lowering effects, are considered potential interventions for NAFLD. This review aimed to present the current understanding of the effects of statins on liver physiology in the context of NAFLD. The pathophysiology of NAFLD includes steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, which are exacerbated by dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. Statins, which inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, have pleiotropic effects beyond cholesterol-lowering and affect pathways related to inflammation, fibrogenesis, oxidative stress, and microcirculation. Although clinical guidelines support the use of statins for dyslipidemia in patients with NAFLD, more studies are needed to demonstrate their efficacy in liver disease. This comprehensive review serves as a foundation for future studies on the therapeutic potential of statins in NAFLD.

abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play pivotal roles in the development and progression of various diseases, including malignant tumors. However, the biological functions and the underlying mechanisms of many circRNAs remain elusive. In this study, we identified a novel circRNA, circTP63-N, generated through the splicing of exons 2-4 of the TP63 gene in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). circTP63-N was found to be downregulated in clinical samples of NPC. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments unequivocally demonstrated that circTP63-N inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of NPC cells. Further investigations revealed that circTP63-N interacted with the HSP90AB1 protein, leading to the recruitment of LATS/YAP1 proteins. This, in turn, induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination-dependent degradation of YAP1, resulting in reduced nuclear translocation of YAP1 and inhibition of the transcriptional activation of downstream oncogenic genes, including INHBA, MMP3, and CCNE2. Our findings highlight the identification of circTP63-N, a novel circRNA encoded by an important tumor-relevant gene TP63 and elucidate its molecular mechanism as a tumor suppressor in NPC. These insights offer novel potential molecular markers and therapeutic targets for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of NPC.

abstract: Corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN), located in the motor cortex of the brain, are one of the key components of the motor neuron circuitry. They are in part responsible for the initiation and modulation of voluntary movement, and their degeneration is the hallmark for numerous diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), hereditary spastic paraplegia, and primary lateral sclerosis. Cortical hyperexcitation followed by in-excitability suggests the early involvement of cortical dysfunction in ALS pathology. However, a high-spatiotemporal resolution on our understanding of their functional health and connectivity is lacking. Here, we combine optical imaging with high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA) system enabling single cell resolution and utilize UCHL1-eGFP mice to bring cell-type specificity to our understanding of the electrophysiological features of healthy CSMN, as they mature and form network connections with other cortical neurons, in vitro. This novel approach lays the foundation for future cell-type specific analyses of CSMN that are diseased due to different underlying causes with cellular precision, and it will allow the assessment of their functional response to compound treatment, especially for drug discovery efforts in upper motor neuron diseases.

abstract: Aging is a process accompanied by functional decline in tissues and organs with great social and medical consequences. Developing effective anti-aging strategies is of great significance. In this study, we demonstrated that transplantation of young hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) into old mice can mitigate aging phenotypes, underscoring the crucial role of HSCs in the aging process. Through comprehensive molecular and functional analyses, we identified a subset of HSCs in aged mice that exhibit "younger" molecular profiles and functions, marked by low levels of CD150 expression. Mechanistically, CD150low HSCs from old mice but not their CD150high counterparts can effectively differentiate into downstream lineage cells. Notably, transplantation of old CD150low HSCs attenuates aging phenotypes and prolongs lifespan of elderly mice compared to those transplanted with unselected or CD150high HSCs. Importantly, reducing the dysfunctional CD150high HSCs can alleviate aging phenotypes in old recipient mice. Thus, our study demonstrates the presence of "younger" HSCs in old mice, and that aging-associated functional decline can be mitigated by reducing dysfunctional HSCs.

abstract: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by persistent tissue injury, dysregulated wound healing, and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition by myofibroblasts (MFs) through the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT). Implicit in the FMT process are changes in the ECM and cellular topology, but their relationship with the lung fibroblast phenotype has not been explored. We engineered topological mimetics of alignment cues (anisotropy/isotropy) using lung decellularized ECM micropattern arrays and investigated the effects of cellular topology on cellular fates in MRC-5 lung fibroblasts. We found that isotropic MRC-5 cells presented changes of the cytoskeleton, increased cell-cell adhesions and a multicellular architecture with increased overlap, changes in actin-myosin development, and enhanced focal adhesion and cell junction with random alignment. Besides, anisotropic fibroblasts were activated into a regular phenotype with an ECM remodeling profile. In contrast, isotropic fibroblasts developed a highly invasive phenotype expressing molecules, including CD274/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), cellular communication network factor 2 (CCN2)/connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), and semaphorin 7A (SEMA7A), but with downregulated matrix genes. Moreover, isotropic fibroblasts also showed higher expressions of Ki-67 and cyclin D1 (CCND1), resistance to apoptosis/senescence, and decreased autophagy. The topology regulated the cellular heterogeneity and resulted in positive feedback between changes in the cellular phenotype and the ECM structure, which may aggravate fibrosis and lead to a priming of malignant microenvironment during carcinogenesis. Using the versatile platform of micropattern array, we can not only visualize the interaction mechanism between cells and the ECM but also select potential clinical targets for diagnosis and therapeutics.

abstract: To fully harness mesenchymal-stromal-cells (MSCs)' benefits during Normothermic Machine Perfusion (NMP), we developed an advanced NMP platform coupled with a MSC-bioreactor and investigated its bio-molecular effects and clinical feasibility using rat and porcine models. The study involved three work packages: 1) Development (n = 5): MSC-bioreactors were subjected to 4 h-liverless perfusion; 2) Rat model (n = 10): livers were perfused for 4 h on the MSC-bioreactor-circuit or with the standard platform; 3) Porcine model (n = 6): livers were perfused using a clinical device integrated with a MSC-bioreactor or in its standard setup. MSCs showed intact stem-core properties after liverless-NMP. Liver NMP induced specific, liver-tailored, changes in MSCs' secretome. Rat livers exposed to bioreactor-based perfusion produced more bile, released less damage and pro-inflammatory biomarkers, and showed improved mithocondrial function than those subjected to standard NMP. MSC-bioreactor integration into a clinical device resulted in no machine failure and perfusion-related injury. This proof-of-concept study presents a novel MSC-based liver NMP platform that could reduce the deleterious effects of ischemia/reperfusion before transplantation.

abstract: Research into mechanisms underlying sleep traditionally relies on electrophysiology and genetics. Because sleep can only be measured on whole animals by behavioral observations and physical means, no sleep research was initiated by biochemical and chemical biological approaches. We used phosphorylation sites of kinases important for sleep as targets for biochemical and chemical biological approaches. Sleep was increased in mice carrying a threonine-to-alanine substitution at residue T469 of salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3). Our biochemical purification and photo-crosslinking revealed calcineurin (CaN) dephosphorylation, both in vitro and in vivo, of SIK3 at T469 and S551, but not T221. Knocking down CaN regulatory subunit reduced daily sleep by more than 5 h, exceeding all known mouse mutants. Our work uncovered a critical physiological role for CaN in sleep and pioneered biochemical purification and chemical biology as effective approaches to study sleep.

abstract: Pulmonary artery (PA) flow analysis is crucial for understanding the progression of pulmonary hypertension (PH). We hypothesized that PA flow characteristics vary according to PH etiology. In this study, we used 4D flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) to compare PA flow velocity and wall shear stress (WSS) between patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and pulmonary hypertension (PH-HFpEF). We enrolled 13 PAH and 15 PH-HFpEF patients. All participants underwent echocardiography, 4D flow CMR, and right heart catheterization. We compared right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) flow and main pulmonary artery (MPA) hemodynamics, including peak velocity and mean and maximum WSS, between groups. PH-HFpEF patients were older and more likely to have hypertension. PAH patients had higher mean PA pressure (47.8 ± 8.8 vs. 32.9 ± 6.9 mmHg, p < 0.001) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (8.6 ± 4.6 vs. 2.6 ± 2.2 wood unit, p < 0.001). RVOT systolic notching was more common in PAH patients (8 of 13 vs. 0 of 15), and they had shorter RVOT acceleration time (85.5 ± 20.9 vs. 135.0 ± 21.7 ms, p < 0.001). PAH patients had lower MPA Vmax (0.8 ± 0.2 vs. 1.1 ± 0.4 m/s, p = 0.032), mean WSS (0.29 ± 0.09 vs. 0.36 ± 0.06 Pa, p = 0.035), and maximal WSS (0.99 ± 0.18 vs. 1.21 ± 0.19 Pa, p = 0.011). Anterior MPA analysis confirmed lower WSS in PAH patients. PVR was negatively correlated with MPA mean WSS (r = -0.630, p = 0.002). PAH patients had lower MPA Vmax and lower mean MPA WSS in 4D flow CMR compared to PH-HFpEF patients. These distinct PA flow characteristics suggest that the flow hemodynamics of the PA remodeling process differ depending on the underlying etiology of PH.

abstract: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a progressive condition characterized by ectopic fat accumulation in the liver, for which no FAD-approved drugs currently exist. Emerging evidence highlights the role of liver kinase B1 (LKB1), a key metabolic regulator, has been proposed in NAFLD, particularly in response to excessive nutrient levels. However, few agents have been identified that can prevent the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by targeting LKB1 deacetylation. Through comprehensive screening of our in-house chemical library, we identified tranilast, a small molecule with remarkable inhibitory efficacy against lipid deposition induced by palmitic acid/oleic acid (PO). In this study, we investigated the novel biological function and mechanism of tranilast in regulating hepatic lipid response in NAFLD, focusing on its role in LKB1 deacetylation within hepatocytes. Our findings demonstrate that tranilast effectively reduced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in NASH models induced by high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFHC) and methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diets. Mechanistic analysis using RNA sequencing revealed that tranilast mitigated hepatic lipid response by promoting LKB1 deacetylation and activating AMPK. Notably, in vivo experiments showed that the beneficial effects of tranilast in MCD diet-induced NASH model were reversed by the compound C (C-C), a known AMPK inhibitor, confirming that tranilast's effects on hepatic lipid response are mediated through the AMPK pathway. In summary, tranilast inhibits hepatic lipid response in NAFLD through LKB1 deacetylation, providing robust experimental evidence for the role of LKB1 in NAFLD. These findings position tranilast as a promising therapeutic candidate for the pharmacological management of metabolic diseases.

abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most incapacitating neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). PD is the second most common NDD worldwide which affects approximately 1 to 2 percent of people over 65 years. It is an attractive pursuit for artificial intelligence (AI) to contribute to and evolve PD treatments through drug repositioning by repurposing existing drugs, shelved drugs, or even candidates that do not meet the criteria for clinical trials. A search was conducted in three databases Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. We reviewed the data related to the last years (1975-present) to identify those drugs currently being proposed for repositioning in PD. Moreover, we reviewed the present status of the computational approach, including AI/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-powered pharmaceutical discovery efforts and their implementation in PD treatment. It was found that the number of drug repositioning studies for PD has increased recently. Repositioning of drugs in PD is taking off, and scientific communities are increasingly interested in communicating its results and finding effective treatment alternatives for PD. A better chance of success in PD drug discovery has been made possible due to AI/ML algorithm advancements. In addition to the experimentation stage of drug discovery, it is also important to leverage AI in the planning stage of clinical trials to make them more effective. New AI-based models or solutions that increase the success rate of drug development are greatly needed.

abstract: Growth differentiation factor 15, GDF15, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues act through brainstem neurons that co-localise their receptors, GDNF-family receptor α-like (GFRAL) and GLP1R, to reduce food intake and body weight. However, their use as clinical treatments is partially hampered since both can also induce sickness-like behaviours, including aversion, that are mediated through a well-characterised pathway via the exterolateral parabrachial nucleus. Here, in mice, we describe a separate pathway downstream of GFRAL/GLP1R neurons that involves a distinct population of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) cells in the medial nucleus of the tractus solitarius. Thus, BDNFmNTS neurons are required for the weight-reducing actions of both GDF15 and the GLP1RA, Exendin-4. Moreover, acute activation of BDNFmNTS neurons is sufficient to reduce food intake and drive fatty acid oxidation and might provide a route for longer-term weight loss.

abstract: Background: The tolerance and dynamic regulation of the maternal immune system during pregnancy are pivotal for ensuring fetal health. Immune cell subsets play a complex and crucial role in this process, closely linked to the neonatal health status. Despite recognizing the significance of dysregulation in the quantity and activity of immune cells in neonatal disease occurrence, their specific roles remain elusive, resulting in a dearth of clinically viable interventions for immune-mediated neonatal diseases. Materials and Methods: Employing two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) methodology, this study systematically investigated 446 leukocyte features (N = 500,675), including leukocyte subsets, absolute cell (AC) counts, and morphological parameters (MP) and their correlation with seven adverse fetal outcomes (N = 1,100,458), encompassing fetal growth restriction (FGR), preterm birth (PTB), neonatal jaundice (NNJ), digestive system disorders of fetus and newborn (DSDFN), hemorrhagic and hematological disorders of fetus and newborn (HDFN), respiratory distress of newborn (RDN), and transitory disorders of metabolism specific to fetus and newborn (TDMSFN). Results: The results unveiled significant causal relationships between 301 leukocyte subsets and these seven adverse fetal outcomes, with 259, 245, 15, 44, 11, 32, and 68 pairs of notable associations for each adverse outcome, respectively. Furthermore, the study highlighted potential pathogenic mechanisms underlying the mutual influence among neonatal diseases. MR results indicated FGR as a robustly correlated risk factor for PTB and NNJ and showed a reciprocal causal relationship between NNJ and FGR. PTB exhibited a positive correlation with HDFN. Conclusions: This study provided profound insights into the intricate regulatory mechanisms of leukocyte subsets in neonatal diseases, paving the way for new avenues in the diagnosis and treatment of associated disorders.

abstract: Recent cohort studies suggest a potential association between atopic dermatitis and dementia, though the evidence remains conflicting. This study aims to elucidate the association between atopic dermatitis and dementia employing systematic review, meta-analysis, and Mendelian randomization (MR). A comprehensive search was performed to select eligible cohort studies using Medline, Embase, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and the Web of Science database. In MR analysis, genomic data from the Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) (864,982 European individuals) for atopic dermatitis cases and dementia cases were obtained from the MRBase. Statistical analyses included the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, sensitivity tests, and MR-PRESSO for outliers. The adjustment accounted for various factors, including sex, age, smoking status, and other medical comorbidities, along with several additional variables. In the systematic review and meta-analysis, 5 longitudinal cohort studies (12,576,235 participants) indicated a significant association between atopic dermatitis and all-cause dementia (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.07-1.23). Subgroup analyses revealed an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.08-1.27) for Alzheimer's disease in patients with atopic dermatitis, and an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.21-1.55) for all-cause dementia in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. However, MR analysis showed no significant causal link between atopic dermatitis and dementia, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or cognitive performance. While the meta-analysis revealed a significant association, MR analysis did not substantiate a significant causal link. Future research should consider demographic variables and medication influences in unravelling the intricate atopic dermatitis-dementia interplay.

abstract: In the current era of immune therapy, lenvatinib (LEN) continues to be vital for treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) patients. This study investigates the importance of nutritional status in the prognosis of uHCC patients receiving LEN and evaluates a new prognostic scoring system that combines the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) and systemic inflammatory response. From 2018 to 2022, 484 uHCC patients treated with LEN (384 males, median age 73). Prognostic value was compared between GNRI and C-reactive protein (CRP) scoring (GNRI-C score), GNRI, and neo-Glasgow prognostic score (neo-GPS). Evaluation was based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and concordance index(c-index). Median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 9.3/6.8/4.6 months for GNRI no-risk/low-risk/moderate-to-major risk (p < 0.01, AIC 4742.4/c-index 0.585). Median overall survival (mOS) was 27.8/15.2/9.5 months (p < 0.01, AIC 3433.34/c-index 0.639). For GNRI-C score, mPFS was 10.8/7.1/5.6/4.0 months (score 0/1/2/3) (p < 0.01, AIC 4732.82/c-index 0.6), while neo-GPS showed mPFS of 8.5/5.1/5.2 months (p < 0.01, AIC 4745.89/c-index 0.562). For mOS, GNRI-C score demonstrated 28.6/20.0/10.1/8.4 months (score 0/1/2/3) (p < 0.01, AIC 3420.27/c-index 0.652), while neo-GPS indicated 21.0/12.4/4.5 months (p < 0.01, AIC 3468.84/c-index 0.564). The newly devised GNRI-C score, incorporating nutritional and inflammatory markers, could offer improved prognostic predictions for uHCC patients treated with LEN.

abstract: The cellular concentrations of splicing factors (SFs) are critical for controlling alternative splicing. Most serine and arginine-enriched (SR) protein SFs regulate their own concentration via a homeostatic feedback mechanism that involves regulation of inclusion of non-coding 'poison exons' (PEs) that target transcripts for nonsense-mediated decay. The importance of SR protein PE splicing during animal development is largely unknown despite PE ultra-conservation across animal genomes. To address this, we used mouse genetics to disrupt an ultra-conserved PE in the Tra2b gene encoding the SR protein Tra2β. Focussing on germ cell development, we found that Tra2b PE deletion causes azoospermia due to catastrophic cell death during meiotic prophase. Failure to proceed through meiosis was associated with increased Tra2b expression sufficient to drive aberrant Tra2β protein hyper-responsive splice patterns. Although critical for meiotic prophase, Tra2b PE deletion spared earlier mitotically active germ cells, even though these still required Tra2b gene function. Our data indicate that PE splicing control prevents the accumulation of toxic levels of Tra2β protein that are incompatible with meiotic prophase. This unexpected connection with male fertility helps explain Tra2b PE ultra-conservation and indicates the importance of evaluating PE function in animal models.

abstract: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a common neurological trauma that cannot be completely cured with surgical techniques and medications. In this study, we established a mouse SCI model and used an adeno-associated virus (AAV) to achieve the high expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh) at the injury site to further investigate the therapeutic effect and mechanism of Shh on SCI. The results of the present study show that Shh may promote motor function recovery. The present findings demonstrate the protective effect of Shh overexpression in SCI by regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of nerve cells at the site of SCI. Shh promotes the proliferation of early microglia, inhibits the proliferation of early astrocytes, and promotes the formation of neurons at the site of injury. In addition, Shh may inhibit apoptosis at the SCI site. The mechanism by which Shh regulates nerve cells at the site of SCI may involve glioma-associated oncogene 1 (Gli1). The present research indicates that Gli1 regulates the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway, inhibiting the classic TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway and activating the TGF-β1/extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Collectively, these findings suggest that Shh is a regulatory molecule involved in nerve cell proliferation and apoptosis. High Shh expression can accelerate motor function recovery after SCI, indicating that it may be a promising therapeutic approach for SCI.

abstract: The athlete's paradox states that intramyocellular triglyceride accumulation associates with insulin resistance in sedentary but not in endurance-trained humans. Underlying mechanisms and the role of muscle lipid distribution and composition on glucose metabolism remain unclear. We compared highly trained athletes (ATHL) with sedentary normal weight (LEAN) and overweight-to-obese (OVWE) male and female individuals. This observational study found that ATHL show higher insulin sensitivity, muscle mitochondrial content, and capacity, but lower activation of novel protein kinase C (nPKC) isoforms, despite higher diacylglycerol concentrations. Notably, sedentary but insulin sensitive OVWE feature lower plasma membrane-to-mitochondria sn-1,2-diacylglycerol ratios. In ATHL, calpain-2, which cleaves nPKC, negatively associates with PKCε activation and positively with insulin sensitivity along with higher GLUT4 and hexokinase II content. These findings contribute to explaining the athletes' paradox by demonstrating lower nPKC activation, increased calpain, and mitochondrial partitioning of bioactive diacylglycerols, the latter further identifying an obesity subtype with increased insulin sensitivity (NCT03314714).

abstract: Virus-host protein interaction is critical for successful completion of viral replication cycles. As the largest nonstructural protein (NSP) of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), NSP2 plays multiple and critical roles in viral replication, antiviral immunity, cellular tropism and virulence. An interactome of this protein with host proteins would be instrumental in full understanding of these multifunctional roles. In this study, we report the identification of 120 NSP2-interacting host proteins by co-immunoprecipitation coupled liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, via rescuing and utilizing a recombinant PRRSV expressing an HA-tagged NSP2. By comparing and subtracting with cells infected with parental virus, a comprehensive interactome was constructed. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these host factors are mainly involved in translation regulation, metabolism, signal transduction and innate immunity signaling pathways. Selection of five host proteins (CtBP1, CtBP2, HSPA2, PPP1CA, SH3KBP1) for further verification and characterization confirmed their interactions with NSP2 and differential effects on PRRSV replication. Intriguingly, interaction of NSP2 and SH3KBP1 led to specific cleavage of SH3KBP1, antagonizing its pro-apoptotic activity. Taken together, this study provides overarching views on the NSP2-host interactome, paving a solid foundation for functional studies of host proteins in PRRSV biology and their potential as targets for novel therapeutics development.

abstract: Myeloid cells accumulate extensively in most tumors and play a critical role in immunosuppression of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Like T cells, myeloid cells also express immune checkpoint molecules, which induce the immunosuppressive phenotype of these cells. In this review, we summarize the tumor-promoting function and immune checkpoint expression of four types of myeloid cells: macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which are the main components of the TME. By summarizing the research status of myeloid checkpoints, we propose that blocking immune checkpoints on myeloid cells might be an effective strategy to reverse the immunosuppressive status of the TME. Moreover, combining nanotechnology, cellular therapy, and bispecific antibodies to achieve precise targeting of myeloid immune checkpoints can help to avoid the adverse effects of systemic administration, ultimately achieving a balance between efficacy and safety in cancer therapy.

abstract: High-dose methotrexate (MTX) results in high rates of acute kidney injury (AKI), neutropenia, and hepatotoxicity. Glucarpidase is a recombinant enzyme that cleaves MTX, but clinical data supporting its use are scarce. We examined the association between glucarpidase administration and outcomes in adults with MTX-AKI from 28 cancer centers across the U.S using a sequential target trial emulation framework. The primary end point was kidney recovery at hospital discharge, defined as survival to discharge with serum creatinine <1.5-fold baseline and without dialysis-dependence. Key secondary end points were time-to-kidney recovery, neutropenia and transaminitis on day 7, and time-to-death. Using multivariable logistic and Cox regression models, we compared outcomes in patients who received glucarpidase within 4 days following MTX initiation with those in patients who did not. Among 708 patients with MTX-AKI, 209 (29.5%) received glucarpidase. Overall, 183 (25.8%) had a primary end point event. Glucarpidase receipt was associated with a 2.70-fold higher adjusted odds of kidney recovery (95% CI, 1.69-4.31) compared to no glucarpidase receipt. Patients treated with glucarpidase also had faster time-to-kidney recovery (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.88, 95% CI, 1.18-3.33) and lower risks of grade ≥2 neutropenia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.50, 95% CI, 0.28-0.91) and grade ≥2 transaminitis (aOR, 0.50, 95% CI, 0.28-0.91) on day 7. There was no difference in time-to-death (aHR, 0.76; 95 CI, 0.49-1.18). These data suggest glucarpidase may improve both renal and extrarenal outcomes in patients with MTX-AKI.

abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects the elderly population and is the leading cause of dementia. Meanwhile, the vascular hypothesis suggests that vascular damage occurs in the early stages of the disease, leading to neurodegeneration and hindered waste clearance, which in turn triggers a series of events including the accumulation of amyloid plaques and Tau protein tangles. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), have been found to be involved in the regulation of AD. Furthermore, lncRNAs and circRNAs can act as competitive endogenous RNAs to inhibit miRNAs, and their interactions can form a complex regulatory network. Exosomes, which are extracellular vesicles (EVs), are believed to be able to transfer ncRNAs between cells, thus playing a regulatory role in the brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Exosomes are part of the intercellular carrier system; therefore, utilizing exosomes to deliver drugs to recipient cells might not activate the immune system, making it a potential strategy to treat central nervous system diseases. In this review, we review that AD is a multifactorial neurological disease and that ncRNAs can regulate its multiple pathogenic mechanisms to improve our understanding of the etiology of AD and to simultaneously regulate multiple pathogenic mechanisms of AD through the binding of ncRNAs to exosomes to improve the treatment of AD.

abstract: The therapeutic window of antibody drug-conjugates (ADC) remains challenging due to safety issues such as interstitial lung disease (ILD) observed with specific deruxtecan-based ADCs. To avoid ILD, we designed M9140 by conjugating the maleimide-containing hydrophilic β-glucuronide linker to exatecan and our anti-CEACAM5 (CarcinoEmbryonic Antigen-related Cell Adhesion Molecule 5) specific antibody. Following repeated iv-infusion at 3 to 30 mg/kg of M9140 every 3 weeks, the pathological findings obtained in cynomolgus monkeys were confined to gastrointestinal and hematolymphoid tissues and resembled the toxicity of exatecan. At 24 mg/kg or higher, transient reductions in neutrophil and reticulocyte counts were observed with each dosing event along with reversible anemia throughout the study. The no observed adverse effect level was 24 mg/kg and the maximum tolerated dose was 30 mg/kg. The difference in toxicity by this small dose increment was correlated with a 2.5-fold difference in plasma exatecan exposure indicating antigen-independent toxicity. As anticipated, no lung toxicity was found with M9140 in these studies that were similar in study design to those used to confirm ILD with trastuzumab-deruxtecan in monkeys. Since the non-human primate model is regarded as predictive for the ILD risk in humans, this result indicates a low risk for ILD when applying M9140 to patients. The current M9140 safety data are discussed with special focus on the absence or presence of ILD with other antibody camptothecin-conjugates, for which a hypothetical pathogenic mechanism is postulated here. The favorable nonclinical profile of M9140 warrants further investigation in patients with CEACAM5-overexpressing tumors.

abstract: Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is a condition in which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) acquire mutations seen in leukemia. While individuals with CH generally do not show signs of hematologic disease, the condition becomes more common with age and correlates with age-related diseases, especially cardiovascular disease (CVD). JAK2 mutations in HSCs can lead to CH and correlate with atherosclerosis, but the condition has been difficult to study because of challenges modeling the mutant cells at very low frequency. In this issue of the JCI, Liu et al. developed a low-allele-burden (LAB) mouse model in which a small number of bone marrow cells carrying the Jak2VF mutation were transplanted into mice predisposed to hyperlipidemia. Along with recapitulating features of plaque development, the authors identified the phagocytic receptors MERTK and TREM2 in WT cells as downstream of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1. These findings provide potential targets for preventing or treating patients at risk for CH-associated CVD.

abstract: Many known and unknown historical events have remained below detection thresholds of genetic studies because subtle ancestry changes are challenging to reconstruct. Methods based on shared haplotypes1,2 and rare variants3,4 improve power but are not explicitly temporal and have not been possible to adopt in unbiased ancestry models. Here we develop Twigstats, an approach of time-stratified ancestry analysis that can improve statistical power by an order of magnitude by focusing on coalescences in recent times, while remaining unbiased by population-specific drift. We apply this framework to 1,556 available ancient whole genomes from Europe in the historical period. We are able to model individual-level ancestry using preceding genomes to provide high resolution. During the first half of the first millennium CE, we observe at least two different streams of Scandinavian-related ancestry expanding across western, central and eastern Europe. By contrast, during the second half of the first millennium CE, ancestry patterns suggest the regional disappearance or substantial admixture of these ancestries. In Scandinavia, we document a major ancestry influx by approximately 800 CE, when a large proportion of Viking Age individuals carried ancestry from groups related to central Europe not seen in individuals from the early Iron Age. Our findings suggest that time-stratified ancestry analysis can provide a higher-resolution lens for genetic history.

abstract: Research over the past two decades has established a remarkable ability of the gut microbiota to modulate brain activity and behaviour. Conversely, signals from the brain can influence the composition and function of the gut microbiota. This bidirectional communication across the gut microbiota-brain axis, involving multiple biochemical and cellular mediators, is recognized as a major brain-body network that integrates cues from the environment and the body's internal state. Central to this network is the gut sensory system, formed by intimate connections between chemosensory epithelial cells and sensory nerve fibres, that conveys interoceptive signals to the central nervous system. In this Review, we provide a broad overview of the pathways that connect the gut and the brain, and explore the complex dialogue between microorganisms and neurons at this emerging intestinal neuroepithelial interface. We highlight relevant microbial factors, endocrine cells and neural mechanisms that govern gut microbiota-brain interactions and their implications for gastrointestinal and neuropsychiatric health.

abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors against PD-1/PD-L1 are highly effective in immunologically hot tumours such as triple-negative breast cancer, wherein constitutive DNA damage promotes inflammation, while inducing PD-L1 expression to avoid attack by cytotoxic T cells. However, whether and how PD-L1 regulates the DNA damage response and inflammation remains unclear. Here, we show that nuclear PD-L1 activates the ATR-Chk1 pathway and induces proinflammatory chemocytokines upon genotoxic stress. PD-L1 interacts with ATR and is essential for Chk1 activation and chromatin binding. cGAS-STING and NF-κB activation in the late phase of the DNA damage response is inhibited by PD-L1 deletion or by inhibitors of ATR and Chk1. Consequently, the induction of proinflammatory chemocytokines at this stage is inhibited by deletion of PD-L1, but restored by the ATR activator Garcinone C. Inhibition of nuclear localisation by PD-L1 mutations or the HDAC2 inhibitor Santacruzamate A inhibits chemocytokine induction. Conversely, the p300 inhibitor C646, which accelerates PD-L1 nuclear localisation, promotes chemocytokine induction. These findings suggest that nuclear PD-L1 strengthens the properties of hot tumours and contributes to shaping the tumour microenvironment.

abstract: The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of TiRobot-assisted treatment for femoral neck fractures, in comparison to traditional freehand treatment methods. Throughout the research process, we conducted an extensive literature search across numerous databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), CQVIP, and Wanfang. Based on the literature screening criteria, we selected six studies, encompassing 358 cases of femoral neck fracture patients, for this meta-analysis. The study evaluated the effectiveness of TiRobot-assisted versus freehand placement of the Femoral Neck System (FNS). The results indicate that the TiRobot-assisted group demonstrated significant advantages in several surgical parameters. Specifically, the robot-assisted group showed superior outcomes regarding the frequency of guide pin insertion, frequency of X-ray fluoroscopy, operative time, invasive fixation time, intraoperative blood loss and incision length (MD < 0, p < 0.05). Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the Harris score, between the TiRobot-assisted group and the traditional freehand group (MD > 0, p < 0.05). However, the two groups had no significant differences concerning postoperative complications, fracture healing time, and fracture healing rate (p > 0.05). In conclusion, the comprehensive analysis suggests that the TiRobot-assisted technique has distinct advantages over the traditional freehand technique in treating femoral neck fractures. TiRobot-assisted technology, owing to its enhanced safety and efficacy, minimizes surgical trauma and expedites postoperative recovery.

abstract: Our previous studies revealed the existence of a Universal Receptive System that regulates interactions between cells and their environment. This system is composed of DNA- and RNA-based Teazeled receptors (TezRs) found on the surface of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, as well as integrases and recombinases. In the current study, we aimed to provide further insight into the regulatory role of TezR and its loss in Staphylococcus aureus gene transcription. To this end, transcriptomic analysis of S. aureus MSSA VT209 was performed following the destruction of TezRs. Bacterial RNA samples were extracted from nuclease-treated and untreated S. aureus MSSA VT209. After destruction of the DNA-based-, RNA-, or combined DNA- and RNA-based TezRs of S. aureus, 103, 150, and 93 genes were significantly differently expressed, respectively. The analysis revealed differential clustering of gene expression following the loss of different TezRs, highlighting individual cellular responses following the loss of DNA- and RNA-based TezRs. KEGG pathway gene enrichment analysis revealed that the most upregulated pathways following TezR inactivation included those related to energy metabolism, cell wall metabolism, and secretion systems. Some of the genetic pathways were related to the inhibition of biofilm formation and increased antibiotic resistance, and we confirmed this at the phenotypic level using in vitro studies. The results of this study add another line of evidence that the Universal Receptive System plays an important role in cell regulation, including cell responses to the environmental factors of clinically important pathogens, and that nucleic acid-based TezRs are functionally active parts of the extrabiome.

abstract: Programmed cell death protein ligand-1 (PD-L1) and major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) are key molecules related to tumor immune evasion and resistance to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 blockade. Here, we demonstrated that the upregulation of all miRNAs in the miR-23a/27a/24 - 2 cluster was correlated with poor survival, immune evasion and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade resistance in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overexpression of all miRNAs in the miR-23a/27a/24 - 2 cluster upregulated PD-L1 expression by targeting Cbl proto-oncogene B (CBLB) and downregulated MHC-I expression by increasing the level of eukaryotic initiation factor 3B (eIF3B) via the targeting of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). In addition, we demonstrated that the expression of the miR-23a/27a/24 - 2 cluster of miRNAs is maintained in NSCLC through increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling-regulated interaction of transcription factor 4 (TCF4) and the miR-23a/27a/24 - 2 cluster promoter. Notably, pharmacologic targeting of the eIF3B pathway dramatically increased sensitivity to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in patients with high expression of the miR-23a/27a/24 - 2 cluster in NSCLC. This effect was achieved by increasing MHC-I expression while maintaining high expression of PD-L1 induced by the miR-23a/27a/24 - 2 cluster. In summary, we elucidate the mechanism by which the miR-23a/27a/24 - 2 cluster miRNAs maintain their own expression and the molecular mechanism by which the miR-23a/27a/24 - 2 cluster miRNAs promote tumor immune evasion and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade resistance. In addition, we provide a novel strategy for the treatment of NSCLC expressing high levels of the miR-23a/27a/24 - 2 cluster.

abstract: The essential amino acid methionine plays a pivotal role in one-carbon metabolism, facilitating the production of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a critical supplier for DNA methylation and thereby a modulator of gene expression. Here, we report that the methionine cycle is disrupted in skeletal muscle during cancer cachexia, leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress and DNA hypomethylation-induced expression of the DNA damage inducible transcript 4 (Ddit4) gene, encoding the regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1) protein. Targeting DNA methylation by depletion or pharmacological inhibition of DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) exacerbates cachexia, while restoring DNMT3A expression or REDD1 knockout alleviates cancer cachexia-induced skeletal muscle atrophy in mice. Methionine supplementation restores DNA methylation of the Ddit4 promoter in a DNMT3A-dependent manner, thereby inhibiting activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-mediated Ddit4 transcription. Thus, with the identification of the methionine/SAM-DNMT3A/DNA hypomethylation-Ddit4/REDD1 axis, our study provides molecular insights into an epigenetic mechanism underlying cancer cachexia, and it suggests nutrient supplementation as a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent or reverse cachectic muscle atrophy.

abstract: Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among all gynecological malignancies, and drug resistance renders the current chemotherapy agents ineffective for patients with advanced metastatic tumors. We report an effective treatment strategy for targeting metastatic ovarian cancer involving a nanoformulation (Bola/IM)─bola-amphiphilic dendrimer (Bola)-encapsulated imatinib (IM)─to target the critical mediator of ovarian cancer stem cells (CSCs) CD117 (c-Kit). Bola/IM offered significantly more effective targeting of CSCs compared to IM alone, through a novel and tumor-specific β-catenin/HRP2 axis, allowing potent inhibition of cancer cell survival, stemness, and metastasis in metastatic and drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Promising results were also obtained in clinically relevant patient-derived ascites and organoids alongside high tumor-oriented accumulation and favorable pharmacokinetic properties in mouse models. Furthermore, Bola/IM displayed synergistic anticancer activity when combined with the first-line chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin in patient-derived xenograft mouse models without any adverse effects. Our findings support the use of Bola/IM as a nanoformulation to empower IM, providing targeted and potent treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer. Our study thus represents a significant advancement toward addressing the unmet medical need for improved therapies targeting this challenging disease.

abstract: Skeletal muscle dysfunction (SMD), one of the extrapulmonary complications in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), considerably influences patient prognosis. Mitochondria regulates their dynamic networks through a mitochondria quality control (MQC) mechanism, involving mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitophagy. The MQC is crucial for mitochondrial homeostasis and health, and disruption of it can lead to mitochondrial damage, which is a key factor in the structural and functional impairment of skeletal muscle in COPD. The mitochondria in the skeletal muscles of these patients undergo changes, mainly including decrease in mitochondrial density and biogenesis levels, imbalanced mitochondrial fission and fusion, and altered mitophagy status. However, the potential mechanisms linking MQC to the damaged structure and function of skeletal muscles in COPD have not been fully clarified. Therefore, this review highlights the effects and potential pathways of the MQC system on the dysfunction of skeletal muscle (muscle atrophy, impaired myogenesis and regeneration, and aerobic endurance) in patients with COPD, and summarizes potential interventions targeted MQC, intending to provide a theoretical basis for further research on COPD, improve SMD, and enhance the quality of life.

abstract: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) can have serious consequences as it hinders individuals from detecting important warning signals like smoke, spoiled food, and gas leaks. This can significantly impact their nutritional status, eating satisfaction, and overall quality of life. Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common disease that greatly affects the quality of life and can lead to a decrease, distortion, or complete loss of olfactory ability. There are various tools available for diagnosing OD, ranging from simple screening tests to more detailed and complex methods such as electrophysiological and imaging procedures not available in everyday practice but reserved for experimental studies. The underlying mechanisms by which AR impacts olfactory ability are still not fully understood and are likely to be multifactorial. Current therapeutic options for OD resulting from AR are limited and only provide partial or temporary relief from olfactory impairment. However, there are promising treatments investigated such as biologics, olfactory training, neural stem cell transplantation, and various novel target therapies that might help improve OD in AR in the future. This review aims to evaluate the epidemiology, mechanisms, and detection of OD in AR, as well as provide an overview of the management strategies for OD secondary to AR.

abstract: To summarize the recent literature regarding the interaction between the public health concerns of obesity and depression and provide preliminary recommendations for assessment and management of patients with co-occurring obesity and depression. RECENT FINDINGS : Recent studies have reinforced that while there is a bi-directional link between obesity and depression, there is stronger evidence that obesity contributes to the development of depression. Recent research has also elucidated potential mediating factors in the association between depression and obesity (e.g., demographical, biological, and psychological) as well as a moderating effect of treatment of depression on outcomes for treatment of obesity. There is evidence to suggest that in co-occurring depression and obesity, it is beneficial to treat depression first. Cognitive behavioral therapies have demonstrated effectiveness in treating co-occurring depression and obesity and there is preliminary evidence suggesting that increasing emotion regulation and reducing weight bias internalization may be important treatment targets.

abstract: New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Despite identifying numerous factors contributing to NOAF, the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. This study introduces the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG index) as a predictive indicator and establishes a clinical predictive model. We included 551 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) without a history of atrial fibrillation (AF). These patients were divided into two groups based on the occurrence of postoperative NOAF during hospitalization: the NOAF group (n = 94) and the sinus rhythm (SR) group (n = 457). We utilized a regression model to analyze the risk factors of NOAF and to establish a predictive model. The predictive performance, calibration, and clinical effectiveness were evaluated using the receiver operational characteristics (ROC), calibration curve, decision curve analysis, and clinical impact curve. 94 patients developed NOAF during hospitalization. TyG was identified as an independent predictor of NOAF and was significantly higher in the NOAF group. Left atrial (LA) diameter, age, the systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI), and creatinine were also identified as risk factors for NOAF. Combining these with the TyG to build a clinical prediction model resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.780 (95% CI 0.358-0.888). The ROC, calibration curve, decision curve analysis, and clinical impact curve demonstrated that the performance of the new nomogram was satisfactory. By incorporating the TyG index into the predictive model, NOAF after AMI during hospitalization can be effectively predicted. Early detection of NOAF can significantly improve the prognosis of AMI patients.

abstract: The tedious synthesis and limited throughput biological evaluation remain a great challenge for discovering new proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC). To rapidly identify potential PROTAC lead compounds, we report a platform named Auto-RapTAC. Based on the modular characteristic of the PROTAC molecule, a streamlined workflow that integrates lab automation with "click chemistry" joint building-block libraries was constructed. This facilitates the autonomous generation of a variety of PROTACs, each with distinct linkers and E3 ligase ligands, all stored in biocompatible solutions. The ready-for-screening (R4S) approach, when paired with fluorescence-based assays, enables the efficient assessment of the PROTAC degradation activity in a high-throughput manner. To further test the capability of the platform, we identify six new PROTACs that target CDK2, CDK12, and BCL6 within a mere 8-day time frame for each target. In all, this platform could find broad application not only in discovering new PROTACs but also in the rapid development of novel heterobifunctional modalities.

abstract: Extracellular matrix (ECM) is a network of macromolecules which has two forms - perineuronal nets (PNNs) and a diffuse ECM (dECM) - both influence brain development, synapse formation, neuroplasticity, CNS injury and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. ECM remodeling can influence extrasynaptic transmission, mediated by diffusion of neuroactive substances in the extracellular space (ECS). In this study we analyzed how disrupted PNNs and dECM influence brain diffusibility. Two months after oral treatment of rats with 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), an inhibitor of hyaluronan synthesis, we found downregulated staining for PNNs, hyaluronan, chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These changes were enhanced after 4 and 6 months and were reversible after normal diet. Morphometric analysis further indicated atrophy of astrocytes. Using real-time iontophoretic method dysregulation of ECM resulted in increased ECS volume fraction α in somatosensory cortex (SC) by 35 %, from α = 0.20 in control rats to α = 0.27 after the 4-MU diet. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) revealed a decrease of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, pallidum and spinal cord. This study shows the increase in ECS volume, a loss of FA and changes in astrocytes due to modulation of PNNs and dECM that could affect extrasynaptic transmission, cell to cell communication and neural plasticity.Significance Statement Inhibition of hyaluronan synthesis induced by oral treatment with 4-methylumebelliferone disrupts perineuronal nets (PNNs), diffuse extracellular matrix (dECM), reduces the astrocytic network, increases extracellular space (ECS) volume and changes ECS geometry. The changes of diffusion barriers significantly affect diffusion parameters in the adult brain and spinal cord. Our findings suggest that disruption of ECM allows for more efficient transport of ions, neurotransmitters and neuroactive substances in the ECS and thus ensures broader inter-neuronal communication by extrasynaptic transmission. Disruption of PNNs and an increase in ECS volume can result in enhanced crosstalk between synapses, spill-over of transmitters, formation of new synaptic contacts and thus increased synaptic plasticity.

abstract: Background:
        
      
      Over the past decade, facial aesthetics has gained popularity, with a notable increase in upper-face lift procedures. Despite the popularity of brows and forehead lifts, the optimal fixation technique remains controversial. Common methods involve suturing of the temporal fascia or using monocortical miniscrews anchored to the frontal bone. Other options include the use of microscrews, percutaneous fixation posts, Kirschner wires, Mitek anchors, Endotine devices, bone tunnels, miniplates, and fibrin glue. This study introduces a new technique that transmits the pulling force directly to the brow/forehead skin through subperiosteal dissection using the scalp as a suspension point.

abstract: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients often face a grim prognosis due to lymph node metastasis. However, a comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular characteristics of metastatic lymph nodes in ESCC remains elusive. In this study involving 12 metastatic ESCC patients, we employed single-cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics (ST), and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) to explore the spatial and molecular attributes of primary tumor samples, adjacent tissues, metastatic and non-metastatic lymph nodes. The analysis of 161,333 cells revealed specific subclusters of epithelial cells that were significantly enriched in metastatic lymph nodes, suggesting pro-metastatic characteristics. Furthermore, stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment, including MMP3+IL24+ fibroblasts, APLN+ endothelial cells, and CXCL12+ pericytes, were implicated in ESCC metastasis through angiogenesis, collagen production, and inflammatory responses. Exhausted CD8+ T cells in a cycling status were notably prevalent in metastatic lymph nodes, indicating their potential role in facilitating metastasis. We identified distinct cell-cell communication networks and specific ligand-receptor pathways. Our findings were validated through a spatial transcriptome map and mIHC. This study enhances our comprehension of the cellular and molecular aspects of metastatic lymph nodes in ESCC patients, offering potential insights into novel therapeutic strategies for these individuals.

abstract: In contrast to adult mammalian hearts, the adult zebrafish heart efficiently replaces cardiomyocytes lost after injury. Here we reveal shared and species-specific injury response pathways and a correlation between Hmga1, an architectural non-histone protein, and regenerative capacity, as Hmga1 is required and sufficient to induce cardiomyocyte proliferation and required for heart regeneration. In addition, Hmga1 was shown to reactivate developmentally silenced genes, likely through modulation of H3K27me3 levels, poising them for a pro-regenerative gene program. Furthermore, AAV-mediated Hmga1 expression in injured adult mouse hearts led to controlled cardiomyocyte proliferation in the border zone and enhanced heart function, without cardiomegaly and adverse remodeling. Histone modification mapping in mouse border zone cardiomyocytes revealed a similar modulation of H3K27me3 marks, consistent with findings in zebrafish. Our study demonstrates that Hmga1 mediates chromatin remodeling and drives a regenerative program, positioning it as a promising therapeutic target to enhance cardiac regeneration after injury.

abstract: The death and clearance of nurse cells is a consequential milestone in Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis. In preparation for oviposition, the germline-derived nurse cells bequeath to the developing oocyte all their cytoplasmic contents and undergo programmed cell death. The death of the nurse cells is controlled non-autonomously and is precipitated by epithelial follicle cells of somatic origin acquiring a squamous morphology and acidifying the nurse cells externally. Alternatively, stressors such as starvation can induce the death of nurse cells earlier in mid-oogenesis, manifesting apoptosis signatures, followed by their engulfment by epithelial follicle cells. To identify and contrast the molecular pathways underlying these morphologically and genetically distinct cell death paradigms, both mediated by follicle cells, we compared their genome-wide transcriptional, translational, and secretion profiles before and after differentiating to acquire a phagocytic capability, as well as during well-fed and nutrient-deprived conditions. By coupling the GAL4-UAS system to Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP-seq) and proximity labeling (HRP-KDEL) followed by Liquid Chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry, we performed high-throughput screens to identify pathways selectively activated or repressed by follicle cells to employ nurse cell-clearance routines. We also integrated two publicly available single-cell RNAseq atlases of the Drosophila ovary to define the transcriptomic profiles of follicle cells. In this report, we describe the genes and major pathways identified in the screens and the striking consequences to Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis caused by RNAi perturbation of prioritized candidates. To our knowledge, our study is the first of its kind to comprehensively characterize two distinct apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death paradigms in the same multi-cellular system. Beyond molecular differences in cell death, our investigation may also provide insights into how key systemic trade-offs are made between survival and reproduction when faced with physiological stress.

abstract: A correlation between UA levels and the development of hypertension has been demonstrated. However, the relationship between UA and all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension remains underexplored. A nonlinear association between UA and all-cause mortality across sexes was observed through smoothed curve fitting. The correlation between UA and all-cause mortality was calculated by threshold and saturation effect analysis, along with Cox regression models. The stability of the results in the presence of different comorbidities was verified through stratified analysis for interaction testing. Smoothed curve fitting was also used to examine the association between UA and various diseases. The association between UA and all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension exhibited a U-shaped curve, with inconsistent inflection points between the sexes. In male patients with hypertension, all-cause mortality gradually decreased with increasing UA levels when UA levels were ≤ 7.2 mg/dL (HR 0.975; 95% CI 0.929-1.024) and gradually increased with increasing UA levels when UA levels were > 7.2 mg/dL (HR 1.204; 95% CI 1.120-1.294). Similar findings were observed in female patients with hypertension, with UA as a protective factor when UA levels were ≤ 5.1 mg/dL (HR 0.902; 95% CI 0.820-0.991) and a risk factor when UA levels were > 5.1 mg/dL (HR 1.120; 95% CI 1.072-1.169). The association between UA and all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension exhibits a U-shaped curve. All-cause mortality tends to decrease and then increase with increasing UA levels, with the inflection point varying between sexes.

abstract: Compared with long bone that arises from the mesoderm, the major portion of the maxillofacial bones and the front bone of the skull are derived from cranial neural crest cells and undergo intramembranous ossification. Human skeletal stem cells have been identified in embryonic and fetal long bones. Here, we describe a single-cell atlas of the human embryonic mandible and identify a population of cranio-maxillofacial skeletal stem cells (CMSSCs). These CMSSCs are marked by interferon-induced transmembrane protein 5 (IFITM5) and are specifically located around the periosteum of the jawbone and frontal bone. Additionally, these CMSSCs exhibit strong self-renewal and osteogenic differentiation capacities but lower chondrogenic differentiation potency, mediating intramembranous bone formation without cartilage formation. IFITM5+ cells are also observed in the adult jawbone and exhibit functions similar to those of embryonic CMSSCs. Thus, this study identifies CMSSCs that orchestrate the intramembranous ossification of cranio-maxillofacial bones, providing a deeper understanding of cranio-maxillofacial skeletal development and promising seed cells for bone repair.

abstract: In the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis transcription and translation are uncoupled and the translational machinery is located at the cell poles. During sporulation, the cell undergoes morphological changes including asymmetric division and chromosome translocation into the forespore. However, the fate of translational machinery during sporulation has not been described. Here, using microscopy and mass spectrometry, we show the localisation of ribosomes during sporulation in wild type and mutant Bacillus subtilis. We demonstrate that ribosomes are associated with the asymmetric septum, a functionally important organelle in the cell's developmental control, and that SpoIIDMP-driven peptidoglycan rearrangement is crucial for ribosomes packing into the forespore. We also show that the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ 'feeding-tube' channel is not required for ribosome translocation. Our results demonstrate that translation and translational machinery are temporally and spatially organised in B. subtilis during sporulation and that the forespore 'inherits' ribosomes from the mother cell. We propose that the movement of ribosomes in the cell may be mediated by the bacterial homologs of cytoskeletal proteins and that the cues for asymmetric division localisation may be translation-dependent. We anticipate our findings to elicit more sophisticated structural and mechanistic studies of ribosome organisation during bacterial cell development.

abstract: Thyroid diseases are increasingly prevalent, posing significant challenges to patients' quality of life and placing substantial financial burdens on families and society. Despite these impacts, the underlying pathophysiology of many thyroid conditions remains poorly understood, complicating efforts in treatment, management, and prevention. Observational studies can identify associations between exposure variables and disease; however, they often struggle to account for confounding factors and reverse causation. Understanding disease occurrence, epidemiological trends, and clinical diagnosis, prevention, and treatment relies heavily on robust etiological research. Mendelian randomization, a method grounded in genetics and epidemiology, has been widely employed in studying the etiology of thyroid diseases, offering a solution to some of these challenges. This paper categorizes thyroid diseases into thyroid dysfunction and thyroid cancer, reviewing related Mendelian randomization studies. It further provides novel perspectives and approaches for investigating the mechanisms underlying thyroid diseases and designing intervention strategies.

abstract: Variants of SARS-CoV-2 have continued to emerge across the world and cause hundreds of deaths each week. Due to the limited efficacy of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and resistance to current therapies, additional anti-viral therapeutics with pan-coronavirus activity are of high interest. Here, we screen 2.8 billion compounds from a DNA-encoded chemical library and identify small molecules that are non-covalent inhibitors targeting the conserved 3CL protease of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. We perform structure-based optimization, leading to the creation of a series of potent, non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibitors, for coronavirus infections. To characterize their binding mechanism to the 3CL protease, we determine 16 co-crystal structures and find that optimized inhibitors specifically interact with both protomers of the native homodimer of 3CL protease. Since 3CL protease is catalytically competent only in the dimeric state, these data provide insight into the design of drug-like inhibitors targeting the native homodimer state. With a binding mode different from the covalent 3CL inhibitor nirmatrelvir, the protease inhibitor in the COVID drug Paxlovid, these compounds may overcome resistance reported for nirmatrelvir and complement its clinical utility.

abstract: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations like the common L858R and exon 19 deletions are well studied, but rarer mutations like exon 19 insertions have received less attention. This case report describes a patient with this uncommon EGFR exon 19 insertion mutation in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. A 51-year-old male nonsmoker with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma and a rare EGFR exon 19 insertion mutation experienced disease progression on initial carboplatin-pemetrexed chemotherapy. However, treatment with the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor afatinib led to a partial response, with significant regression of the primary tumor and bone metastases. This case highlights the favorable clinical response to afatinib treatment in a patient with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer harboring a rare EGFR exon 19 insertion mutation.

abstract: Advanced atherosclerosis is the pathological basis for acute cardiovascular events, with significant residual risk of recurrent clinical events despite contemporary treatment. The death of foamy macrophages is a main contributor to plaque progression, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated that massive iron accumulation in advanced atherosclerosis promoted foamy macrophage ferroptosis, particularly in low expression of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2low) foamy macrophages. This cluster exhibits metabolic characteristics with low oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), increasing ferroptosis sensitivity. Mechanically, upregulated heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1)-lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) interaction enables Lon peptidase 1 (LONP1) to degrade mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis. Administration of the mitochondria-targeted reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger MitoTEMPO (mitochondrial-targeted TEMPO) or LONP1 inhibitor bortezomib restored mitochondrial homeostasis in foamy macrophages and alleviated atherosclerosis. Collectively, our study elucidates the cellular and molecular mechanism of foamy macrophage ferroptosis, offering potential therapeutic strategies for advanced atherosclerosis.

abstract: Cancer-associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) have emerged as critical regulators of anti-tumour immunity, with both beneficial and detrimental properties that remain poorly characterised. To investigate this, we performed single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analysis, comparing head & neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) subgroups, which although heterogenous, can be considered broadly immune-hot and immune-cold (human papillomavirus [HPV]+ve and HPV-ve tumours respectively). This identified six fibroblast subpopulations, including two with immunomodulatory gene expression profiles (IL-11 + inflammatory [i]CAF and CCL19 + fibroblastic reticular cell [FRC]-like). IL-11 + iCAF were spatially associated with inflammatory monocytes and regulated in vitro through synergistic activation of canonical NF-κB signalling by IL-1β and TNF-α. FRC-like were enriched in immune-hot HPV+ve tumours, associated with CD4 + T-cells and B-cells in tertiary lymphoid structures and regulated through non-canonical NF-κB signalling via lymphotoxin. Pan-cancer analysis revealed several 'iCAF' subgroups present in both normal and cancer tissues; IL11 + iCAF were found in cancers from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and transcriptomically distinct from iCAFs previously described in pancreatic and breast cancers with greater inflammatory properties; FRC-like fibroblasts were present at low frequencies in all tumour types, and were associated with significantly better survival in patients receiving checkpoint immunotherapy. This work clarifies and expands current literature on immunomodulatory CAFs, highlighting links with important immunological niches.

abstract: TMEM16A, a key calcium-activated chloride channel, is crucial for many physiological and pathological processes such as cancer, hypertension, and osteoporosis, etc. However, the regulatory mechanism of TMEM16A is poorly understood, limiting the discovery of effective modulators. Here, we unveil an allosteric gating mechanism by presenting a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of TMEM16A in complex with a channel inhibitor that we identified, Tamsulosin, which is resolved at 2.93 Å. Tamsulosin wedges itself into a pocket within the extracellular domain of TMEM16A, surrounded by α1-α2, α5-α6, and α9-α10 loops. This binding stabilizes a transient preopen conformation of TMEM16A, which is activated by Ca2+ ions while still preserving a closed pore to prevent Cl- permeation. Validation of this binding site through computational, electrophysiological, and functional experiments, along with site-directed mutagenesis, confirmed the pivotal roles of the pocket-lining residues R605 and E624 on α5-α6 loop in modulating Tamsulosin binding and pore activity. Tamsulosin induces significant positional shifts in extracellular loops, particularly the α5-α6 loop, which moves toward the extracellular exit of the pore, leading to noticeable structural rearrangements in pore-lining helices. The hinges induced by P595 in α5 and G711 in α7 introduce flexibility to the transmembrane helices, orienting Y593 to collaborate with I641 in effectively gating the preopening pore. Notably, Tamsulosin demonstrates significant antiosteoporotic effects by inhibiting TMEM16A, suggesting potential for its repurposing in new therapeutic indications. Our study not only enhances our understanding of the gating mechanism of TMEM16A inhibition but also facilitates structure-based drug design targeting TMEM16A.

abstract: Acne vulgaris (AV) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the pilosebaceous units characterized by multiple immunologic, metabolic, hormonal, genetic, psycho-emotional dysfunctions, and skin microbiota dysbiosis. The latter is manifested by a decreased population (phylotypes, i.e., genetically distinct bacterial subgroups that play different roles in skin health and disease) diversity of the predominant skin bacterial commensal - Cutinbacterium acnes. Like in other dysbiotic disorders, an elevated expression of endogenous antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) is a hallmark of AV. AMPs, such as human β-defensins, cathelicidin LL-37, dermcidin, or RNase-7, due to their antibacterial and immunomodulatory properties, function as the first line of defense and coordinate the host-microbiota interactions. Therefore, AMPs are potential candidates for pharmaceutical prophylaxis or treating this condition. This study outlines the current knowledge regarding the importance of AMPs in AV pathomechanism in light of recent transcriptomic studies. In particular, their role in improving the tight junctions (TJs) skin barrier by activating the fundamental cellular proteins, such as PI3K, GSK-3, aPKC, and Rac1, is discussed. We hypothesized that the increased expression of AMPs and their patterns in AV act as a compensatory mechanism to protect the skin with an impaired permeability barrier. Therefore, AMPs could be key determinants in regulating AV development and progression, linking acne-associated immune responses and metabolic factors, like insulin/IGF-1 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR/FoxO1 signaling pathways or glucotoxicity. Research and development of anti-acne AMPs are also addressed.

abstract: Disulfidptosis is a newly discovered type of regulated cell death triggered by disulfide bond accumulation and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) depletion due to glucose deprivation. However, the regulatory mechanisms involving additional cellular circuits remain unclear. Excessive disulfide bond accumulation can impair endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and activate the ER stress response. In this study, we found that SLC7A11-mediated disulfidptosis upon glucose deprivation is accompanied by ER stress induction. Pharmacological inhibition of SLC7A11-mediated cystine uptake or cystine withdrawal not only blocks disulfidptosis under glucose starvation but also suppresses the ER stress response, indicating a close link between these processes. Moreover, inhibitors targeting the ER stress response promote disulfidptosis, while ER stress inducers suppress glucose starvation-induced disulfidptosis in SLC7A11-high-expressing cells, suggesting a protective role for ER stress during disulfidptosis. Similar effects are observed in cells treated with glucose transporter inhibitors (GLUTi). Finally, combined treatment with ER stress inhibitors and GLUTi significantly suppresses tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo by inducing disulfide stress and subsequent disulfidptosis. In summary, these findings reveal a novel role for ER stress in regulating disulfidptosis and provide theoretical insights into the potential application of GLUTi and ER stress inhibitors in cancer therapy.

abstract: In this study, we delve into the intrinsic mechanisms of cell communication in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Initially, employing single-cell sequencing, we analyze multiple malignant cell subpopulations and cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) subpopulations, revealing their interplay through receptor-ligand interactions, with a particular focus on SPP1. Subsequently, employing unsupervised clustering analysis, we delineate two clusters, C1 and C2, and compare their infiltration characteristics using various tools and metrics, uncovering heightened cytotoxicity and overall invasion abundance in C1. Furthermore, our gene risk scoring model indicates heightened activity of the immune therapeutic pathway in C1. Lastly, employing a formulated scoring system, we stratify patients into high and low-risk groups, revealing notably poorer outcomes in the high-risk cohort on Kaplan-Meier curves. Risk scores exhibit a negative correlation with model genes and immune cell infiltration scores, indicating poor prognosis in the high-risk group. Further characterization elucidates the regulatory landscape of the high and low-risk groups across various signaling pathways. In addition, we used wet lab experiments to prove that ABCA1 plays a pro-oncogenic role in hepatocellular carcinoma cells by promoting proliferation, invasion, migration, and reducing apoptosis. In summary, these findings provide crucial insights, offering valuable clues and references for understanding HCC pathogenesis and patient prognosis.

abstract: Plant-derived extracellular vesicles (PEVs) have been regarded as a superior source for nanomedicine and drug delivery systems. Nevertheless, their clinical translation is hindered by the lack of clarity and even contradiction in their biomedical applications. Herein, we conducted a comprehensive compositional analysis of four commonly used PEVs to fully understand their functional lipid contents and assess their potential therapeutic applications. The lipidomic analysis revealed the presence of cytotoxic gingerols and shogaols in ginger-derived EVs (GEVs). Subsequent in vitro and in vivo investigations substantiated the remarkable tumor cell inhibitory and tumor growth suppression efficacy of GEVs. The transcriptomic analysis indicated that GEVs regulate the cell cycle and p53 signaling pathways, thereby inducing cancer cell apoptosis. The supplementary proteomic analysis suggested the potential protein markers in PEV research. These findings highlight the value of multi-omics analyses in elucidating the potential therapeutic effects of PEVs and in advancing the development of PEV-based therapies.

abstract: Loss of Y chromosome (LOY) is the most commonly occurring post-zygotic (somatic) mutation in male individuals. The past decade of research suggests that LOY has important effects in shaping the activity of the immune system, and multiple studies have shown the effects of LOY on a range of diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease and acute infection. Epidemiological findings have been corroborated by functional analyses providing insights into the mechanisms by which LOY modulates the immune system; in particular, a causal role for LOY in cardiac fibrosis, bladder cancer and Alzheimer disease has been indicated. These insights show that LOY is a highly dynamic mutation (such that LOY clones expand and contract with time) and has pleiotropic, cell-type-specific effects. Here, we review the status of the field and highlight the potential of LOY as a biomarker and target of new therapeutics that aim to counteract its negative effects on the immune system.

abstract: Crop genomes accumulate deleterious mutations-a phenomenon known as the cost of domestication. Precision genome editing has been proposed to eliminate such potentially harmful mutations; however, experimental demonstration is lacking. Here we identified a deleterious mutation in the tomato transcription factor SUPPRESSOR OF SP2 (SSP2), which became prevalent in the domesticated germplasm and diminished DNA binding to genome-wide targets. We found that the action of SSP2 is partially redundant with that of its paralog SSP in regulating shoot and inflorescence architecture. However, redundancy was compromised during tomato domestication and lost completely in the closely related species Physalis grisea, in which a single ortholog regulates shoot branching. We applied base editing to directly repair the deleterious mutation in cultivated tomato and obtained plants with compact growth that provide an early fruit yield. Our work shows how deleterious variants have sensitized modern genotypes for phenotypic tuning and illustrates how repairing deleterious mutations with genome editing may allow predictable crop improvement.

publication_date: 2025 Jan 3;20(1):2.
abstract: Background:
With extended gefitinib treatment, the therapeutic effect in some non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients declined with the development of drug resistance. Aidi injection (ADI) is utilized in various cancers as a traditional Chinese medicine prescription. This study explores the molecular mechanism by which ADI, when combined with gefitinib, attenuates gefitinib resistance in PC9GR NSCLC cells.

abstract: Being part of a social structure offers chances for social learning vital for survival and reproduction. Nevertheless, studying the neural mechanisms of social learning under laboratory conditions remains challenging. To investigate the impact of socially transmitted information about rewards on individual behavior, we used Eco-HAB, an automated system monitoring the voluntary behavior of group-housed mice under seminaturalistic conditions. In these settings, male mice spontaneously form social networks, with individuals occupying diverse positions. We show that a rewarded group member's scent affects the ability of conspecifics to search for rewards in familiar and novel environments. The scent's impact depends on the animal's social position. Furthermore, disruption of neuronal plasticity in the prelimbic cortex (PL) disrupts the social networks and animals' interest in social information related to rewards; only the latter is blocked by the acute PL inhibition. This experimental design represents a cutting-edge approach to studying the brain mechanisms of social learning.
